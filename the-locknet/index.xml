&lt;p>The man gazes earnestly into the camera, the glow from his computer monitor reflecting off his black-rimmed glasses. “This is more than just a cultural moment,” he says with a smile. “It’s something truly meaningful. This is about mutual respect, kindness, and efforts to understand each other. This feels so good!” he exclaims in a &lt;a href="http://xhslink.com/a/MtezFxXAEMTbb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">video&lt;/a> he posted to RedNote, a China-based social media platform similar to Instagram.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I. Meatspace: The Locknet IRL</title><link>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Though cyberspace may seem ephemeral and immaterial, it is inherently tied to “meatspace”—the offline, embodied world in which we all live and breathe. The internet, as a product of meatspace, is subject to the dictates of meatspace. Governments and societies around the world seek to mold and constrain the internet in countless ways. In China, this takes several different forms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="administering-the-censorship-system">Administering the Censorship System&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For one, China’s government has produced a raft of &lt;a href="https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/notes-on-china/#law-constrains-the-people-not-the-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-5 hover:text-blue-6 hover:underline decoration-dotted decoration-2 underline-offset-2">laws and regulations pertaining to cyberspace&lt;/a>. These include restrictions on what topics citizens are &lt;a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/governing-the-e-cosystem-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">permitted&lt;/a> to discuss online, what data companies must &lt;a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/managing-the-risks-of-chinas-access-to-us-data-and-control-of-software-and-connected-technology?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">retain and provide&lt;/a> to the government, and what &lt;a href="https://digitalplanet.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DD-Report_1-Jufang-Wang-11.30.22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">news&lt;/a> not produced by &lt;a href="https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/notes-on-china/#the-medias-surname-is-the-party" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-5 hover:text-blue-6 hover:underline decoration-dotted decoration-2 underline-offset-2">state media&lt;/a> may be shared, among others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>II. Service-Level Censorship: The Corporate Locknet</title><link>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Though the much-vaunted “Great Firewall” looms large in the imagination, much of what an average person in China sees or sends online will never come into contact with it. The “Great Firewall” is just that: a digital border flanking the real one, separating domestic and foreign. As long as Chinese internet users are sending group messages in WeChat, opining for the public on Weibo, or livestreaming themselves on Kuaishou, the information they’re transmitting will never leave domestic cyberspace. It will still be subject to surveillance and censorship, of course—but that comes at the hands of private tech companies, who have accepted such tasks as the price of operating in China.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>III. Network-Level Censorship: Locknet in the Wires</title><link>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/part-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/part-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Beijing does not need to censor content posted online by its citizens first-hand; it has a retinue of corporate employees and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150620032219/https://chinadigitaltimes.net/space/Volunteer_fifty_center" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">individual nationalists&lt;/a> to police domestically-generated internet content. Thus, the censorship technology authorities control more directly targets information seeping in from outside China. These tools perform “&lt;a href="https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/the-mechanics-of-online-censorship/censorship-how-china-disrupts-the-network/#network-level-censorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-5 hover:text-blue-6 hover:underline decoration-dotted decoration-2 underline-offset-2">network-level censorship&lt;/a>,” inspecting data headed across the border, regardless of which app or service generated it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IV. Evading the Locknet</title><link>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/part-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/part-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>In February 2022, American-born skier Eileen Gu became an internet sensation in China when she competed at the Beijing Winter Olympics as part of the PRC national team. During her time in China, Gu made multiple posts about her Olympic experiences on Instagram, a platform banned in the mainland. Just before Gu’s freeski big air event, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/OmSOD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">an irked Instagram user asked Gu&lt;/a>: “Why can you use Instagram and millions of Chinese people from mainland cannot, why you got such special treatment as a Chinese citizen. That’s not fair, can you speak up for those millions of Chinese who don’t have internet freedom”. Gu’s response betrayed how little she understood of the Locknet: “anyone can download a vpn its literally free on the App Store 👍”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>V. The Locknet Leaks Out</title><link>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/part-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/part-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>In general, the Locknet only targets communications taking place within or crossing over the country’s borders, removing “bad” or “dangerous” content from circulation. (This contrasts with Beijing’s propaganda efforts, which aim to &lt;em>inject&lt;/em> content into both domestic and international discussions.) Even so, the effects of the censorship regime can and do ripple outwards into the broader world, because the Locknet was designed to be compatible with the global internet. Just as information from the outside can flow into China, systems built to control information can, and occasionally do, flow outwards. Often, this occurs when users outside China want to interact with services, users, or infrastructure inside China, forcing them to rely on the Locknet for tasks they would otherwise do on the internet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VI. The Future of the Locknet</title><link>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/part-6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/part-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>The continued functioning of the Locknet &lt;a href="https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/notes-on-china/#when-and-why-are-chinas-leaders-willing-to-accept-economic-pain-to-enforce-chinas-information-regime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-5 hover:text-blue-6 hover:underline decoration-dotted decoration-2 underline-offset-2">remains existential&lt;/a> for the Chinese Communist Party—it’s a must-have, not a nice-to-have. Control over information, and thus influence over what citizens know and believe, forms part of the bedrock on which the Party edifice stands. In the modern world, this necessarily involves internet censorship. As General Secretary Xi Jinping &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/KyXyQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">said in a 2018 speech&lt;/a>, “Without internet security there is no national security, economic and social stability do not function, and it becomes difficult to safeguard the interests of the majority of the people.” Of course, in China, “internet security” doesn’t just mean keeping one’s data safe. It means content control.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
