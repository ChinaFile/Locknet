The goal of this project is to explain both *how* China has built such an effective system for controlling the flow of information on the internet and *why* its leaders are willing to go to such lengths to do so. I’m a computer scientist, so while the technical side of this enterprise seemed relatively straightforward, I initially found myself quite puzzled at the rationale behind China’s censorship as a whole. Like a lot of folks with degrees in the sciences, during collegemy bachelor’s degree I was required to take exactly one history class (I chose Modern European HIstory) and I knew little about China before beginning this project. However, as I learned more about the country’s political system and how China’s Communist Party (CCP) China’s government and how it has held onto power, its approach to online censorship felt less perplexing.  its motivations became clearer.

Still, many of the CCP’s online and offline actionsactivities simply didn’t make sense to me at first. Why was the government so obsessed with stamping out pornography? Why did it censor archeological scholarship? Why would it ban a group like Falun Gong whose members seemed only to be doing something that looked like yoga? 

Working on this project led me to seek answers to these kinds of questions—both through my own reading on Chinese history and politics, and in conversation with my co-author, Jessica Batke. Eventually, China’s vast censorship system began to feel more coherent and easier to comprehend. 

IfBut, if I had such questions along the way, I assume many of my colleagues in the computer science field may find they have similar ones. Thus, what follows are some short notes on features of China’s politics and society that I found particularly useful as background knowledge to helphelping understand why the system we call Locknet looks the way it does. —Laura Edelson


## Chaos

Chinese officials and ordinary people who support or justify Party-state efforts to clamp down on activism or speech often refer to the fear the country’s leaders and many citizens harbor of chaos (*luan*). The concern is that This arises from an idea that if people can express themselves freely, extreme positions might find favor with the public and lead to widespread questioning of the status quo. Protests and conflict could ensue, causing social, political, and economic collapse—chaos.

The Chinese people did experience repeated political To be sure, China *was* wracked by upheavals in the century before the Chinese Communist Party, under Mao Zedong, finally cemented its rule in 1949\. In its waning years, the Qing, China’s last imperial dynasty, had, whose borders were roughly contiguous with those of the People’s Republic of China, faced an almost uninterrupted succession of threats, which included the Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864), the Second Opium War (18568-1860), the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Boxer Rebellion (1899-1901), and the 1911 Revolution. This last one had brought down the the Qing dynasty, ending and with it ended more than 2,000 years of imperial rule in China. The following decades would see geographic fragmentation, the rise of warlords, invasion and colonization by Japan, and then civil war. 

ThLifChina was again wracked by upheaval many times during the Mao era When the Communists finally took power, waves of political campaigns continued to roil the country. In the decade before Mao’s death, his Cultural Revolution unleashed a period of violence and terror still fresh in the minds of many people of Xi Jinping’s generation. which ended with his death in 1976, especially during the Cultural Revolution when young Red Guards terrorized the country. Memories of this upheaval are still fresh in the minds of people of Xi Jinping’s generation. 

So when Party leaders ruthlessly suppressed the student and worker protests in Tiananmen Squareof in 1989 were ruthlessly suppressed, there was an obvious narrative for the Party to adopt: The bloody crackdown was necessary because hadif the protests been allowed to go on unchecked, the country would once again slide into chaos. Since then, the fear of chaos has been a powerful justification for the Party-state’s iron-fisted control of the internet, news media, religious organizations, and civil society actors. The narrative has proven wildly successful: Many ordinary Chinese people who might want unfettered access to the global internet, open news media, and the freedom to choose their own religion and way of life cite the fear of chaos as a legitimate reason for the government to maintain its monopoly on information. 

## Why Aare China’s Leaders Aafraid of Llarge Ppublic Ggatherings?

Chinese Communist Party leaders have little tolerance for large-scale public gatherings that the government does not control. Part of this undoubtedly owes to their Marxist-Leninist orientation.  Part may derive from earlier homegrown Chinese political thought emphasizing the benefits of social hierarchies, orthodoxy, and respect for rulers. And part might come from a And another part likely from their view of China’s history in which over millenia–as elsewhere in the world–monarchs and emperors were often toppled by popular rebellions led by dissatisfied subjects who came to view their rulers’ dominion over them as illegitimate. China’s leaders are highly attuned to anything that threatens their legitimacy, or their power and the spoils that come with it. 

China’s leaders may also simply believe protests endanger society. Like Xi Jinping himself, they may have come of age during the tumultuous and traumatic decade of the Cultural Revolution when mass demonstrations instigated by Mao took on a violent life of their own, ransacking institutions and norms, tearing at the social fabric with tragic and often deadly consequences.   

Whatever the cause, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) goes to great lengths to suppress protest. The CCP banned the Falun Gong movement in direct reaction to that group’s peaceful protest of the arrest of a handful of its members, and swiftly suppressed the [A4 or “blank paper” protests](https://www.prcleader.org/post/the-a4-movement-mapping-its-background-and-impact) that broke out against COVID-lockdown measures in 2022\.


## The Chinese Communist Party

No political party, in any one country, has ever maintained ruling authority for longer than the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP is the world’s largest political party, with over [99 million members](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3268723/chinas-communist-party-track-100-million-members-years-end). It is woven into and directs the functions of the state in a much deeper way than political parties do in many democracies. 

Xi Jinping is the General Secretary of the CCP, in addition to serving as President of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission. China’s military, the People’s Liberation Army, for example, is an arm  of the CCP, not of the government of China, and reports up through Party channels. Political scientists thus frequently refer to China’s form of government as a “Party-state,” where the organs, processes, and personnel of the Party dominate the functions of the state, even as each has its own set of bureaucratic structures. While the Party has always directed government organs, Xi Jinping has amplified its control of areas of government in which technocrats had more autonomy under previous leaders. 

Most Chinese government jobs, especially at higher levels, [require](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3134071/why-do-so-many-people-join-communist-party-china) CCP membership. Moreover, Party membership also [confers status](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096416) and privilege in many spheres of professional and social life. Generally, members do not play an active role in Party governance, but the CCP may occasionally require them to participate in education programs. All Party members are subject to Party discipline, which means they can be punished/demoted/purged for publicly diverging from Party policy.

## Socialism with Chinese Characteristics 

The Chinese Communist Party may be China’s ruling party, but thinking of China as a purely Communist country does not result in a full or accurate picture of the Party’s ideology or how it is practiced. While Marxist-Lenism may be a major ingredient, CCP ideology blends together a variety of other strains of thinking from Mao Zedong and figures deeper in China’s history as well as newer additions and adaptations. These can be selectively emphasized and deployed to fit the Party’s needs at any given moment. 

After the death of the PRC’s first leaderCCP’s first major leader, Mao Zedong, in 1976, China’s leadership began to abandon some of the country’s its more traditionally Marxist policies—such as collectivization of land and the banning of private enterprise—that Mao had imposed , often traumatically, during the three and a half decades following the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949\.

In the 1980s, China’s next “paramount leader,” Deng Xiaoping, known for emphasizing pragmatism rather than ideological purity, popularized the term “socialism with Chinese characteristics” to describe an ideological framework that allowed the Party to run a market economy, combining state-owned enterprises with private businesses while maintaining absolute political control. 

The Marxist theoretical [justification](https://www.ndrc.gov.cn/xwdt/ztzl/NEW_srxxgcjjpjjsx/yjcg/yw/202401/t20240123_1363634.html) for this is that China is in the “primary stage of socialism,” a transitional period where capitalist methods can be used to develop the productive forces necessary for eventual full socialism.    
   
This model has allowed China to maintain political continuity while achieving rapid economic growth since the 1980s. In 2025, Xi Jinping continues to invoke the phrase, using it in his own signature contribution to CCP ideology, “[Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era](https://www.12371.cn/special/xxzd/hxnr/).” 

## Core Socialist Values

Drawing on both traditions from imperial China and from Marxist-Leninism, China’s current leaders seek to define morality for the country’s citizens. 

At the Chinese Communist Party’s  National Congress in 2012, the year it was announced that Xi Jinping would replace Hu Jintao as its General Secretary, the Party also announced a campaign to promote what it called “[core socialist values,](https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-much-should-we-read-chinas-new-core-socialist-values)” a set of 12 officially approved virtues for citizens to live by, broken out by category: national, social, and individual. Some observers link the emergence of this program to a moment of national horror at eroding morals when news outlets around the country reported the story of a toddler hit by two vansrun over by a truck in the southern Chinese province of GuangdongGuandong, whom numerous passersby left to die in the road. 

NSignificantly, national values appeared first in the lineup—with “prosperity” taking pride of place—while individual values brought up the rear. Also of note, The ideal of “Ffreedom” wasfound itself categorized as a social value, to emphasizinge its status as something to be forged collectively rather than aspired to individually.

National Values

* Prosperity  
* Democracy (which here means a “socialist democratic dictatorship”—the [CCP’s name](https://decodingchina.eu/democracy/) for the current system of government in China)  
* Civility  
* Harmony

Social Values

* Freedom  
* Equality   
* Justice  
* Rule of law 

Individual Values 

* Patriotism  
* Dedication   
* Integrity   
* Friendship

Ever since 2012, the core socialist values have been heavily [promoted](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/world/asia/china-dance-socialist-values.html) in propaganda campaigns on billboards, and integrated into school curricula and government policy frameworks. The visual language of the propaganda campaigns has used motifs and design themes based on traditional Chinese culture, and gone alongside government efforts to instill pride in Chinese culture, revive aspects of Confucianism, and to stamp out “historical nihilism,” which is Party speak for negative views of the Party’s history. 


## Why Does the Party-State Need Moral Authority?

When China’s Communist Party came to power after winning a civil war against the Nationalists 1949, it began a project to remake Chinese culture and society in accordance with its ideology, to build what its leaders called “the new China.” As is often the case in revolutionary contexts, this meant destroying and outlawing institutions, customs and belief systems that had shaped society in the past, in  “the old China.” This process swept up traditional belief systems including Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism, various forms of folk religion, Christianity, which had proliferated in the centuries following its introduction by Jesuits in the 17th century, among many other sources of values and morality. During the Cultural Revolution a campaign against the “four olds” (old ideas, old customs, old culture, old habits) led to a frenzied campaign of destruction of temples, works of art, books, music and many human lives. 

In their place, the institutions and pieties of Maoism formed a kind of state religion, complemented by a cult of personality around Mao himself.

After Mao’s death and in the period of Reform and Opening, new beliefs (and some old ones) began to emerge–libraries at newly reopened universities stocked volumes of Western philosophy, economic theory, and  literature. But with this liberalization came worries about what might fill what was often referred to as the “moral vacuum” that had been left after Maoist orthodoxy had been somewhat abandoned. The Party still aspires to lead and shape norms and behavior from above, a paternalistic stance that has roots in both Marxist-Leninism and traditional Chinese thought. 

THEY STRIPPED AWAY ALL THE OLD MORALITY-STUFF. AND THEN PEOPLE HAD MAOISM AS A KIND OF STATE RELIGION WHICH PROVIDED A KIND OF MORAL STRUCTURE ETC. BUT THEY THEY REJECTED A LOT OF THE UNDERLYING IDEALS OF THAT TO GET RICH AND SO THEIR WAS A VACUUM AND THEY WORRY THAT PEOPLE WILL TRY TO FILL IT WITH IDEAS AND SOURCES OF AUTHORITY THAT THREATEN THEM IF THEY DON’T DO IT FIRST. THE PATERNALISM IS REAL. THE STATE IS DADDY. THIS IS BOTH COMMIE AND OLDER CHINESE CULTURE RESONANT.

The effort need to retain ultimate moral authority can also explains why the Party-state permits just five approved religions within China, and then only under government supervision, why it is extremely wary of foreign NGOs and just as worried about the potential of domestic NGOs and other civil society actors to provide public goods.  

## How Ddoes the Party Jjustify its Rrule?

The Chinese Communist Party has always claimed to represent “the People.” Its military arm is called the People’s Liberation Army, and after the Communists formally took power in 1949, China’s official name was changed to the People’s Republic of China. But there are few ways for ordinary people to participate in China’s governance and political process, unless they join the Communist Party. There are no popular elections for the most powerful offices (like the Presidency), the primacy of the Communist party is written into the constitution, and there are few ways for citizens to hold the government accountable.  

MFurthermore, many people alive today have endured disasters caused by policies and campaigns of the Party-state. The 1958-1962 Great Leap Forward caused one of the world’s deadliest famines with estimated death tolls of between 15 million and 55 million. During the [Cultural Revolution](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/the-cultural-revolution-50-years-on-all-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-political-convulsion),  the economy ground to a halt, universities were shuttered,  [tens of millions](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/world/asia/china-cultural-revolution-explainer.html) of innocent people were persecuted, and between 500,00 to 2 million people were killed. In 1989 the People’s Liberation Army gunned down thousands of unarmed civilians who had been protesting for democratization in Tiananmen Square.

Yet the Party has managed to stay in power. One reason is that dissent is ruthlessly suppressed. Another important factor is “performance legitimacy,” that is the idea that leaders deserve to rule as long as they are effectively providing public goods, and meeting the needs of the people they govern. Over the past four decades, China has experienced a spectacular increase in the average standard of living. The economy has grown at an astounding pace and the country’s influence in global affairs has soared. China’s population has watched farmland sprout skyscrapers, Chinese athletes pile up mountains of Olympic medals, high speed trains. The Party-state trumpets these kinds of achievements, while railing against anything it claims could disrupt the country’s march toward growing strength and wealth. It also works hard to suppress news of instances where official performance has been less than stellar. 

## What is Document No. 9? 

Though the Pparty is famously opaque, sometimes outsiders are able to pierce the veil and catch glimpses of the ideological framework that shapes its governance. Shortly after Xi Jinping came to power in 2013, the Chinese Communist Party circulated [Document 9](https://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation), or as it later came to be  known, the “Seven Don’t Speaks.” This internal communique provided a window into  [the Party’s preoccupations](https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/notes-chinafile/document-9-10-years-later), urging cadres to guard against seven “false ideological trends”:

1) Western cConstitutional dDemocracy  
2) Promoting “uUniversal vValues,” such as “freedom, democracy, and human rights”  
3) Promoting civil society  
4) Economic nNeoliberalism, particularly privatization of state-owned businesses  
5) Freedom of the press,; specifically, “challenging China’s principle that the media and publishing system should be subject to Party discipline”  
6) Historical nihilism, such as “claiming that the revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party resulted only in destruction; denying the historical inevitability in China’s choice of the Socialist road, calling it the wrong path”  
7) Questioning rReform and oOpening and the socialist nature of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The document warned that such  “mistaken views and ideas” often made their way into China via cyberspace: “They penetrate China through the Internet and underground channels and they are disseminated on domestic Internet forums, blogs, and microblogs,” the communique explained., “If we allow any of these ideas to spread, they will disturb people’s existing consensus on important issues like which flag to raise, which road to take, which goals to pursue, etc., and this will disrupt our nation’s stable progress on reform and development.”

Document 9 has proven to be an ideological roadmap for Xi Jinping’s decade-plus rule. Xi has overseen a  clamp down on the press, civil society, academia, and entrepreneurs, again and again using its might to eliminating spaces for free expression. 

## How Does China’s Government Control Private Companies? 

China’s government has many ways beyond law or coercion to encourage or compel compliance with its demands. Many major companies in China are state-owned enterprises. However, the Chinese government has strategic investments even in many non-state- owned companies. Such investments, colloquially known as [“golden shares,”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/xi-jinpings-subtle-strategy-to-control-chinas-biggest-companies-ad001a63) come with more corporate governance rights (in the form of board seats and other lines of communication) than those available to other investors. Golden shares give the Party-state a formal line of authority in the affairs of corporations.  

Yet, the CCP has a means of exerting influence even in firms without golden shares: Party cells. Large companies are required to typically [house](https://www.csis.org/analysis/new-challenge-communist-corporate-governance) official CCP cells, populated by employees who are also Party members and are tasked with acting as liasons between the company and the Party. Foreign companies [must also](https://www.csri.global/research/chinese-communist-cells-in-western-firms) establish these Party cells when they set up shop in China.

## Law constrains the people, not the government 

Many people living in liberal democracies assume that, no matter the party or individuals in control of the government, law can serve as a backstop against unjust treatment at the hands of authorities. This assumption doesn’t hold in China.

China [does not](https://www.cecc.gov/judicial-independence-in-the-prc) have an independent judiciary. In Western liberal democracies, laws typically apply to citizens and the government alike. Judges routinely enforce laws that restrain the executive branch, and high courts can invalidate unconstitutional or otherwise contradictory laws. In China, by contrast, such mechanisms are highly limited: legal avenues for citizens seeking redress for government abuse tend to be narrow and it is virtually impossible for ordinary people to use the law to challenge senior Chinese leaders.

Party leaders clearly know that their unchecked rule has created its own set of governance problems. No less a figure than In 2013, Xi Jinping has [declared](http://www.china.org.cn/china/2013-01/23/content_27767102.htm) that “power should be restricted by the cage of regulations.” He made this statement as part of a larger drive to address one of the primary problems stemming from a subjugated judiciary: [corruption](https://www.chinafile.com/infographics/visualizing-chinas-anti-corruption-campaign).  The Party-state has also paid [lip service](https://www.chinafile.com/conversation/rule-of-law-why-now) to “"rule of law”" in the Core Socialist Values (albeit a social, rather than national, value).

As Elizabeth Economy has [paraphrased](https://lburlamaqui.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/19_Economy-E-.-2018-The-Third-Revolution_-XI-Jinping-and-the-New-Chinese-State.-Oxford-University-Press.pdf), Chinese political scientists Zheng Yongnian and Shan Wei have noted that “there is a stark difference between the understanding of the rule of law in the West and that in China. In the West, the rule of law was developed as a means of restraining arbitrary actions by of those in power. There is no person or group above the law. In China, however, the rule of law is equated with rule by law or ruling the country according to law. The law is an instrument with which the Communist Party can ensure the continued dominance of the party itself.” 

## Jingjing and Chacha

China’s leaders do not need to hide their online surveillance and censorship from their fellow Chinese citizens. This remains the case even though in recent years they have made more censorship tactics covert. 

In the mid 20060s, the internet police in the southern city of Shenzhen debuted two cartoon mascots named [Jingjing and Chacha](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2006/01/image-of-internet-police-jingjing-and-chacha-online-hong-yan-o%C2%BAae%C2%A5%E2%84%A2aaio%C2%BAa/), named for the characters that make up the word *jingcha* (警察), police.

These two served as the friendly faces of the city’s internet police, which were responsible for maintaining a “[healthy](https://www.france24.com/en/20080805-great-wall-censorship-china-internet)” online environment. Inside China, internet users would see the mascots on warning screens when they attempted to access restricted content. They exemplified China’s effort to get its citizens to self-censor, sometimes in very blatant ways, by reminding them that the government was always watching their online activities. 

Though they have ditched the cutesy mascots, authorities have found other ways to communicate to citizens that their online activities are under surveillance, including periodic announcements of punishments levied against both [individuals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0920203X20963010) and [corporations](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/25/china-fines-tech-giants-over-censorship-blocks-whatsapp.html).

## Being invited to tea 

In the late 1990s, as state media organizations were losing subsidies and forced to make products that were appealing to viewers and readers, some Chinese news media organizations began to push against strict censorship and publish investigative stories. During the next decade, the internet was adding millions and then ten of millions of new users every year. In 2003, blogging took off, and some journalists began publishing even more daring work on their own blogs, and they were joined by ordinary people, some of whom began to identify as “citizen journalists.” 

The authorities soon realized that they had a problem, as Party malfeasance, bad governance, corruption, and other social problems began to be exposed by journalists and bloggers. The police and secret police (the Political Security Protection Bureau 政治安全保卫) started using a new strategy: inviting trouble makers to tea for a chat, ewither at a the local police station or sometimes at restaurants or other public venues. This strategy is still in use as of 2025\. 

What happens during these “tea drinking sessions” varies widely, depending on the identity of the offender, the nature of the offense, and the political exigencies of the moment (i.e., sometimes the authorities decide they need to make a political point and deal out harsh consequences for relatively minor offenses). There may not be any tea. But the person “invited to tea” is left with no doubt that they are under scrutiny, and that things could get very much worse if they do not heed the message. 

## “The Media is a Work Unit of the Party” or “The media’s surname is the Party”

The Chinese Party-state has always maintained control over the news media. The rise of the internet, however, presented a challenge to this model of centralized narrative control. 

After Xi Jinping took power, he re-asserted the Party’'s dominance over the news media, including online news media. During In 2016, Xi’s 2016 visit toed the official Xinhua News Agency and the state-owned nationwide broadcaster CCTV,. During his visit, the TV station put up a signbanners that read  “CCTV’'s surname is ‘The Party.’” Later that day, Xi gave a speech in which he said that “media run by the Party and the government are propaganda fronts and must have the Party as their surname.” The media should not just faithfully recite the Party’'s take on current events, it should also proactively boost the Party’s values and view of the world, and  convey “positive energy,” promoting core socialist values via story selection and framing.

Xi’s insistence on tight control of the major national media and news organization has been matched by a crackdown on independent and critical media, and on social media, which despite strict censorship was, had become quite lively from the late 1990s until Xi came to power in ’s first year of rule from November 2012\. 


## What Iis Ppeople’s Eexperience of “the LLocknet”?

China’s censors keep most of their information control mechanisms invisible to users, and many people will never encounter them in ways they can see, such as having their own posts removed or their accounts banned. While some people will experience more censorship than others—the Party-state aggressively surveils and censors certain ethnic and religious groups, for example—*anyone* could suddenly find themself on the wrong side of the line. 

Political “sensitivities,” as China’s leaders call them, shift over time. Users who seek information or comment on topics that might not seem politically charged –a public health crisis like SARS or COVID or a food safety scandal like the infamous 2008 case in which a Chinese company adulterated its [baby formula with melamine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2799451/)\`–might suddenly find the topic censored has crossed into the territory of political threat and thus censorship has commenced. This has happened with public health crises like SARS or COVID, and with food safety scandals like the infamous 2008 case in which a Chinese company adulterated its [baby formula with melamine.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2799451/)\`–This pattern is not unique to Internet use but has also long inflected coverage by China’s newsmedia.   
Since the Party-state's sensitivities shift over time, sometimes abruptly, even users who ordinarily avoid verboten subjects end up typing something taboo. For example, in 2008, a number of infants [suffered](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2799451/) serious illness (and six died) after consuming formula tainted with melamine. Government censors [moved swiftly](https://mediashift.org/2008/10/china-blocks-blogs-search-results-on-tainted-milk-scandal296/) to contain information about the scandal, which surfaced just before the Summer Olympics started in Beijing. Open discussion of the melamine-tainted formula would have inflicted a black eye on the Party-state at the very moment it sought to put its best foot forward on the world stage. If you were a parent of a formula-fed infant in 2008 and you wanted to write online about your baby’s kidney stones, get information about symptoms of melamine poisoning, or find sources of safe formula, you couldn't help but run smack into China’s information control system.. 

At other times, even internet users who tend to avoid forbidden topics may stray across cross a line without knowing it, as a popular a livestreamer did in 2022 when he [showed](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/china/china-tiananmen-li-jiaqi-censorship-intl-hnk/index.html) viewers an ice-cream dessert that resembled a tank—an apparently innocent mistake that happened to take place on June 4, the anniversary of the 1989 military crackdown on protesters at Tiananmen Square. Censors quickly cut his feed. Born in 1992 and raised under China’s censorship regime, he the man may well have been unaware of the massacre as he presented the dessert to his viewing audience. 

## When (and why) are China’s leaders willing to accept economic pain to enforce China’s information regime?

Given that making China’s citizens more prosperous  remains a key source of the CCP's popular legitimacy, Party leaders want to limit the information control system's negative effects on the country's economy. The internet connects Chinese businesspeople, scholars, and online sales companies with their counterparts or customers in other countries. The Party-state does not want to shut down these flows of information or money.

On the other hand, the leadership also sees controlling what the population knows and believes as critical to maintaining its hold on power. It does not want to permit unchecked activity on the internet, even if it would contribute to economic development. As such, it has demonstrated a willingness to shut down online exchanges, even if they are economically beneficial,  in response to perceived threats. Internet users in China often [experience](https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tightens-grip-over-internet-during-key-political-meeting/7521739.html)  drastically reduced connection speeds, an increase in blocked websites, and heightened censorship at certain times in the Party-state's political calendar. In short, the Party-state is willing to bear economic pain commensurate with the perceived threat, whether that threat is temporary or permanent.

The Chinese government could theoretically sever its internet entirely from the larger global network, making it nearly impossible for undesirable foreign information to make it into the country. Doing so, however, would also cut off Chinese businesses from foreign markets and likely provoke a widespread outcry. However, China has proven willing to impose localized internet shutdowns. In 2009, for example, after days of bloody confrontation between ethnic Uyghur and Han citizens on the streets of Urumqi, the government cut off the entire [Xinjiang](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/world/asia/15china.html) Uyghur Autonomous Region from any online services other than those provided by regional authorities—and maintained the blockade for nearly a year. Party-state leaders believe that maintaining moral authority is existential, and therefore have responded to perceived serious threats with a willingness to bear significant costs. However, it is important to note that these measures are flexible and responsive to the scale of perceived threats. When the threats are resolved, the government rescinds the strongest access control measures.
