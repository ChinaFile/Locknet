This project, produced by [ChinaFile](https://www.chinafile.com/), which is an online magazine published by the [Asia Society](https://asiasociety.org/), was funded with support from the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/) (OTF) and [Carnegie Corporation of New York](https://www.carnegie.org/). OTF also introduced us to a number of their other grantees, whose work we have sometimes quoted or cited. However, we have produced this project independently, based on our own research and expertise, and without any editorial guidance or interference from any third party, including OTF.

For safety reasons, some researchers in the fields of China studies and computer science author articles or reports anonymously. Though in general we seek to avoid relying on anonymous work if we do not ourselves know the author, we have made several exceptions during the course of this project. Where these anonymous authors appear in peer-reviewed journals, we have trusted the peer review process to vet the work. In one case, we have cited an anonymous work on the censorship of Wikipedia that contains extensive methodological documentation and has been cited by other experts in the field. 

We have followed the journalistic convention of not footnoting, though wherever possible we have linked to relevant sources. We are happy to respond to individual sourcing questions.

## A Note on Terminology

China’s government comprises both the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the state. The CCP is woven into and directs the functions of the state much more fully than do political parties in many democracies. 

To oversimplify somewhat, the Party determines policy and the state implements these decisions. State organs may offer policy recommendations and implement decisions in ways that shape policy substance and outcomes, but ultimately the Party calls the shots. The Party oversees the selection of state officials, and the vast majority of senior state leaders are also Party members, who lead Party committees in every state organization. 

When we refer to “China’s government,” “the Chinese government,” “Beijing,” or sometimes even “China,” we are glossing over the distinction between the Party and the state because, in many cases, that distinction isn’t relevant to the discussion at hand. We employ similar logic when we mention organs of the Party or state, not identifying them as belonging to one or the other.
