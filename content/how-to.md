This project consists of one [“main” article](/the-locknet/intro/), which serves as the landing page of this website. We’ve covered most of the big-picture themes on this first page, though we encourage you to continue reading about the Locknet in more depth on the succeeding pages (all listed under “The Locknet” in the left sidebar).

We’ve tried to make our work accessible to a wide range of readers: those with or without a computer science background, those with or without China expertise. To this end, you’ll find a number of additional resources at your disposal, available in the left sidebar under the “Additional Materials” heading:

- We created a [glossary of technical terms](/additional-materials/glossary/), which you can access by navigating to the full glossary via the left sidebar. You can also simply click on any term in-text that appears inside a {{< drawer title="blue box" >}}When you click on a glossary term, a definition appears here.{{< /drawer >}} and the glossary definition will appear on the right side of your screen. 

- We also created “explainers” that attempt to answer some of the underlying questions you might find yourself asking as you read the main article. Throughout the article, in-text links will take you to the relevant explainer—though of course you’re welcome to read the explainers on their own. You can find them in the sidebar on the left, under [“Notes on China from a Computer Scientist”](/additional-materials/notes-on-china/) and “The Mechanics of Online Censorship” (which contains [“Internet 101,”](/additional-materials/the-mechanics-of-online-censorship/internet-101/) [“Censorship: How China Disrupts the Network,”](/additional-materials/the-mechanics-of-online-censorship/censorship-how-china-disrupts-the-network/) and [“Blocking Circumvention Technologies”](/additional-materials/the-mechanics-of-online-censorship/blocking-circumvention-technologies/)).


Also under “Additional Materials,” we’ve provided an [Executive Summary](/additional-materials/executive-summary/) that includes the key takeaways of the project.
