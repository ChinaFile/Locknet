Though cyberspace may seem ephemeral and immaterial, it is inherently tied to "meatspace"—the offline, embodied world in which we all live and breathe. The internet, as a product of meatspace, is subject to the whims of meatspace. Governments and societies around the world seek to mold and constrain the internet in countless ways. In China, this takes several different forms. 

## Administering the Censorship System

For one, China's government has produced a raft of laws and regulations pertaining to cyberspace. These include rules about the [topics citizens are permitted to discuss online](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/governing-the-e-cosystem-2/), companies retaining data and [providing it to the government](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/01/managing-the-risks-of-chinas-access-to-us-data-and-control-of-software-and-connected-technology?lang=en), and [restrictions on the sharing of news](https://digitalplanet.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DD-Report_1-Jufang-Wang-11.30.22.pdf) not produced by state media, among others. 

The Party-state has also taken on the administration of a number of mundane processes related to setting up a website—processes either not often required elsewhere in the world or otherwise handled by non-government entities. For example, a company or individual hoping to operate a public-facing website in China must register as an "I[nternet Content Provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/china-network/concepts/icp/)" with the government. The government also controls (through an [affiliated non-profit](https://www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/china-chine/market-facts-faits-sur-le-marche/76359.aspx?lang=eng)) domain name registration within China, meaning that someone wanting to buy the domain name "mysupercoolblog.cn" would have to go through [real-name verification](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/dws/user-guide/real-name-verification-for-cn-domain-names) before they could do so. (At one point in the 1990s, citizens even had to [apply at their local police station](https://web.archive.org/web/20160201194316/https://www.wired.com/1997/06/china-3/) to get permission to go online at all.) This level of government involvement in even personal websites far outstrips what most people experience in the U.S. or Europe.  

A [series](https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinas-new-small-leading-group-cybersecurity-and-internet-management) of special-purpose [offices](https://archive.is/GF2GA) and agencies enforce and handle administrative tasks. These offices have evolved over time, with certain responsibilities delegated across various ministries, but [since 2014](https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/behind-the-facade-of-chinas-cyber-super-regulator/) the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has been the biggest game in town. The CAC not only issues and enforces rules about what's allowed online, it also has a hand in regulating cybersecurity, data security, and privacy—thus touching almost everything a person might do in cyberspace. (The CAC is actually the amalgamation of two agencies, one belonging to the Party and one to the government. Notably, neither of the CAC's two Chinese names contain the word "cyberspace," opting instead for "internet information" (互联网信息) and "network security and informatization" (网络安全和信息化).)

Yet, the Chinese Party-state is not a monolith. The CAC's power at the central level belies the more localized (and haphazardly implemented) censorship that occurs in cities and counties throughout China, in largely powerless local offices scattered across the country. A [2022 academic study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/B1BB347F7458EBF033A65461D1C2D82A/S0305741024000602a.pdf) of these offices noted: 

"China experts and foreign journalists tend to view the state apparatus as omnipotent in censorship. Our fieldwork tells a different story. While national-level \[censorship authorities\] have the capacity to control social media platforms, and the police can silence discontented citizens using coercion, local-level \[censorship offices\] do not have sufficient resources or authority. Instead … staff manually report each negative voice, one by one, using the "Report" page on social media apps."

Yes, you read that correctly: local censorship officials must use the public-facing "report" function on social media sites to try to get content removed. Because most "problematic" content gets handled by higher-ups or the social media platforms themselves, the "negative voices" reported by local censorship staff often pertain to low-level, low-stakes issues—such as when, as described in the study, users mocked a new city mayor's sartorial choices. Issues like these worry no one other than local leaders, who "are the only ones who perceive these voices to be negative. Neither the CAC nor the social media platform cares about the public image of a local official." (In fact, the central government may see some advantage in letting local grievances remain online, "[allow\[ing\] citizens to believe they have an opportunity to voice their opinions and vent their anger, while steering their efforts so as not to seriously jeopardize the central authority or the regime's legitimacy](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/directed-digital-dissidence-in-autocracies-9780197680384?cc=de&lang=en&).")  And thus, low-level officials who incessantly mash the "report" button, and cajole their friends and family into doing the same.

## OutSourcing Censorship

Aware of its limitations, Beijing outsources its censorship of domestic content to private companies. (Beijing does, however, largely handle itself the censorship of information from foreign sites and services—that is, anything crossing the border into China.) According to the CAC's 2020 [Provisions on the Governance of the Online Information Content Ecosystem](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/provisions-on-the-governance-of-the-online-information-content-ecosystem/)," "online information content service platforms" must create mechanisms that allow them to conduct "real-time inspections, emergency response, and the handling of online rumors." Platforms "must not transmit" what the Provisions define as "illegal" information, and "shall prevent and resist the transmission" of "negative" information. Though government warnings are usually enough to ensure any slightly wayward company improves its censorship, the government can [suspend](https://webcitation.org/71y55KoD9) or even shut down platforms if it finds them inadequately compliant. As one Chinese video streaming service noted in its [2020 SEC filing](https://archive.ph//vS4IC), "The Chinese government has wide discretion in regulating online activities and, irrespective of our efforts to control the content on our platform, government campaigns and other actions to reduce illicit content and activities could subject us to negative press or regulatory challenges and sanctions, including fines, suspension or revocation of our licenses to operate in China or a ban on our platform, including closure of one or more parts of or our entire business."

In decades past, when domestic Chinese platforms were less developed, foreign tech companies had a bit more leverage to push back on Beijing's censorship dictates. In 2006, for example, when Google launched its search engine in the mainland, search results [included a notice](https://archive.is/z7dM9) alerting the user when search results had been censored. Authorities hated this behavior, but judged Google too valuable to boot out of the country. The Google notices also gave cover to Chinese search companies, which began to display their own censorship notices. But as China's domestic industry has matured, providing online services that are comparable or even superior to what is available elsewhere, foreign firms, with their superfluous (or blacklisted) offerings, now have little ability to wrest concessions from Beijing. Google [withdrew](https://archive.is/z7dM9) from China in 2010, beginning a slow erosion of what little censorship transparency had existed. In the ensuing years, foreign tech companies have proven willing to accommodate themselves to China's censorship demands. In 2018, leaked documents revealed Google's plans to develop a censored search engine for China; Microsoft's Bing search engine has, on [several](https://archive.nytimes.com/kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/microsoft-and-chinese-censorship/) [occasions](https://archive.ph/3L7Ec), censored "sensitive" search results [even outside of China](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8ztBERe_FUwdkVPbWxkMHJ2ZG8/edit?resourcekey=0-sq4O8stZ7ZZ4FPKBFohKvA).

The government also works closely with companies to conduct surveillance, in order to identify individuals who violate content rules. As described in the book [*The Xi Jinping Effect*](https://uwapress.uw.edu/book/9780295752815/the-xi-jinping-effect/), a hacker discovered in 2019 that China Telecom, one the country's three major internet service providers, had been storing customers' chat logs "from platforms such as Tencent QQ, WeChat, and Apple's iMessage. The database included names, ID numbers, profile pictures, GPS locations, and network information, among other details." Local police throughout the country, meanwhile, had access to the database "for purposes of censorship and surveillance. This system shows that communication software companies, such as WeChat, provide data, while state-owned telecommunications companies, such as China Telecom, are responsible for integrating the data, and public security agencies conduct screening and manual reviews." 

But the Party-state doesn't implicate only tech companies in its censorship regime. The Party views effective information control as a whole-of-society effort, enmeshing civil society and individuals in the process. Per the [CAC Provisions](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/governing-the-e-cosystem-2/), relevant industry associations should "guid\[e\] member units to enhance their sense of responsibility" and create "mechanisms for self-discipline." This merely formalizes what industry associations have been doing for over two decades. In 2002, more than [100 companies](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/29/the-great-firewall-of-china-xi-jinpings-internet-shutdown) signed a "[Public Pledge of Self-Regulation and Professional Ethics for China internet Industry](https://archive.ph/ONfIn);" in 2021, 14 social media companies [signed](https://archive.ph/JFMld) a "Self-Discipline Convention." These "industry associations" are closely linked to the Chinese government, and, of course, companies found in violation of their pledges (i.e., they are failing to sufficiently self-censor) can get shut down.

The [CAC also expects](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/governing-the-e-cosystem-2/) individual users to "interact civilly and express themselves rationally," while avoiding both illegal and negative information. Any individual who creates a chat group becomes responsible for removing undesirable content from that group—essentially making anyone who gathers people together online responsible for the behavior of all involved. Both of these rules explicitly push average users towards self-censorship. And both the government and companies have tried to entice average citizens to report "illegal and harmful content" by offering cash and prizes, essentially [crowdsourcing](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2020.1748079) the discovery of objectionable posts.

## Rules Defining Forbidden Content

But what exactly is "illegal" or "negative" information? The definition of forbidden, or "illegal," information has changed very little since Beijing issued [seminal internet regulations in 2000](http://www.asianlii.org/cn/legis/cen/laws/mfmiis499/). As glossed by the website [China Law Translate](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/governing-the-e-cosystem-2/), "illegal" information consists of:

1. Content opposing the basic principles set forth in the Constitution;  
2. Content endangering national security, divulging State secrets, subverting the national regime, and destroying national unity;  
3. Content harming the nation's honor and interests;  
4. Content demeaning or denying the deeds and spirit of heroes and martyrs;  
5. Content promoting terrorism or extremism,  
6. Content inciting ethnic hatred or ethnic discrimination, or destroying ethnic unity;  
7. Content undermining the nation's policy on religions, promoting cults and superstitions;  
8. Dissemination of rumors, disrupting economic or social order;  
9. Obscenity, erotica, gambling, violence, murder, terror or instigating crime;  
10. Content insulting or defaming others, infringing other persons' honor, privacy, or other lawful rights and interests;  
11. Other content prohibited by laws or administrative regulations.

Some of this tracks with federally prohibited content in the U.S. and elsewhere, such as making threats of imminent violence or libelous statements about another person. But other prohibitions like defaming "heroes and martyrs" are unique to China (and [other authoritarian regimes](https://archive.ph/3gXic)).

The list of "negative information" [appears](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/governing-the-e-cosystem-2/) modeled on restrictions previously only levied on professional broadcasters and the like, reflects the Party's sometimes puritanical blueprint for a "healthy society." It includes:

1. Sensationalizing headlines  
2. Excessive celebrity intrigue and gossip  
3. Improper comments on tragedies  
4. Sexual innuendo, suggestion, or enticement  
5. Gore and horror  
6. Incitement of discrimination  
7. Coarse or vulgar language and behavior  
8. Bad habits or dangerous activity that might be imitated by minors  
9. Other content with a negative impact to the online information ecosystem

The "negative" label might apply to content such as celebrity gossip accounts or queer online fora, both of which have been [shut down](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2020.1748079) in recent years. Such priggish [content prohibitions](https://archive.ph/hJ3TX) may seem incidental to the larger censorship project. But they represent a crucial part of how the Party views itself—as a moral arbiter for the masses—as well as a justification for internet monitoring in the first place. An online censorship regime that targets only undesirable political content might strike citizens as too heavy-handed, but a system that also keeps cyberspace less "seedy"? That's a more credible public good.

## And What They Actually Mean in Practice

Predictably, the content policies of domestic social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo closely [echo](https://archive.is/6D7ZL) the CAC's [lists](https://archive.is/XyVHH). But rarely do either Beijing or Chinese tech companies offer clear preemptive guidance on what constitutes, to take one list item, "endangering national security," nor what specific content has been censored under its auspices. For many years, [leaked government censorship directives](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/directives-from-the-ministry-of-truth/) offered one-off insights into online content control. But these leaks have become rare, and they only show what the government has demanded, not what companies actually implement. 

To understand what gets censored in practice, a series of researchers, including Citizen Lab Senior Research Associate Jeffrey Knockel, have reverse-engineered companies' [keyword blocklists](https://github.com/citizenlab/chat-censorship). Over several [years](https://jeffreyknockel.com/publications/foci2021qqmail.pdf) and [several](https://archive.ph/OJ2d0#selection-1943.291-1963.31) [different](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems/) [projects](https://jeffreyknockel.com/publications/foci2015svps.pdf), the researchers have grouped these keywords into dozens of specific keyword categories, with many of them falling under a few overarching themes, including:

- Political, including content related to the Party, (for instance, ["CCP central leaders step down," "中共中央领导人集体下台"](https://jeffreyknockel.com/publications/foci2021qqmail.pdf)), religion, ethnic issues, and terrorism.  
- People, like the names of government leaders or dissidents. One such keyword was "Jiang Toad" (江蛤蟆), referring to "[a meme started by Chinese netizens likening the appearance of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin to a toad](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems/)."  
- Events, including one-off historical events such as the Tiananmen massacre, one-off contemporary events like protests, or recurring events like the annual Party Congress. For instance, in 2015, some platforms blocked keywords related to the [disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370](https://jeffreyknockel.com/publications/foci2015svps.pdf).  
- Social, such as "prurient" content (e.g. "[Hollywood Sex Photo Gate Torrent](https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-app-two-systems/),", 好莱坞艳照门种子), or content related to illicit goods or gambling.

The first three of these categories will come as no shock to anyone with a passing familiarity with China's political system, which is determined above all else to protect the Party's primacy of place. But the fourth category, comprising both [pornography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhCL5Ygzc24) and gambling, represents Beijing's more paternalistic side—and makes up a significant chunk of the content that gets censored. This is true both of the content that domestic companies must censor at Beijing's behest, and of the foreign content that the government itself censors. One [2023 study](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~dml/papers/tampering_sigcomm23.pdf), monitoring worldwide internet connections that showed signs of being tampered with (read: forcibly disconnected by a third party), found that 18% of all such tampered connections flowing between China and the outside world were related to "adult themes." Similarly, a separate 2024 study found that adult content and gambling were among the [top types of international content](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/papers/gfweb.sec24.pdf) the China blocks.

## NOT JUST CENSORSHIP, BUT ALSO Curation and Content Generation

Censorship, however pervasive, is only a part of China's information control. In addition to removing objectionable content, China's leaders ensure the promotion of content they would like to see instead. The [CAC Provisions](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/governing-the-e-cosystem-2/) mandate that social media platforms "actively present" content that propagates Party doctrine, "Core Socialist Values," and "other content that teaches taste, style, and responsibility; that praises truth, goodness, and beauty; and that promotes unity and stability." Posts that brag about one's wealth? "[Undesirable value-orientated content](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/17/chinese-social-media-companies-remove-posts-showing-off-wealth-and-worshiping-money)." Posts about the Beijing Winter Olympics' "charming" facilities? [A great example of "positive energy."](https://chinamediaproject.org/2023/08/29/positive-energy-gets-positive-reinforcement/)

The Chinese government's reliance on commercial firms for content curation goes beyond giving marching orders. In some cases, individual Chinese government agencies actually [hire for-profit companies](https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/features/message-control-china) to help them monitor internet chatter, especially as it relates to their own organizations and personnel. Such companies alert their government clients to negative posts, provide them the necessary documentation to request such posts' removal, as well as upload new, presumably positive, comments "in order to channel the trend of public opinion."

Such companies are building upon a rich tradition of Chinese government-instigated online commentary that aims to appear spontaneous and grassroots. Chinese internet users have famously dubbed government-aligned commenters and trollsthe "[50-Cent Party](https://rconversation.blogs.com/MacKinnon_Libtech.pdf)," for the 50 cents the government supposedly pays them for each online post. Though such commenters may not have actually earned money per post—they were likely [government employees](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/50c.pdf?m=1463587807), tasked with "guiding public opinion." The scorn such posts engendered eventually spawned the even more derisive moniker, "[fifty-center who brings their own provisions](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/space/Volunteer_fifty_center)" to describe someone who posts on behalf of the government for free.

## Real-Name Registration

Perhaps the best exemplar of China's internet regulatory regime, highlighting both the system's philosophical underpinnings as well as its development over time, is real-name registration. China's  government has long mandated that internet services, such as Weibo and WeChat, register each user with their real-life identities, allowing the government to know the identity of any user upon request. As technology changed, so did Beijing's regulations, chasing users from [internet cafes](https://archive.ph/tmvnv) in the early 2000s to "super-apps" in the 2020s, always with the goal of ensuring that no one remained truly anonymous online. At points in the 2000s and early 2010s, [users](https://archive.ph/tmvnv), [the media](https://archive.ph/tmvnv), and even [companies](https://archive.ph/FA8mI) sometimes pushed back on government mandates for real-name registration, temporarily scuttling implementation on particular platforms. But over time, as Beijing's rules were [codified](https://digitalcommons.law.uw.edu/wilj/vol25/iss1/3/) into [laws](https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-cybersecurity-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-effective-june-1-2017/), and as technological advances made registration and identification [harder to avoid](https://archive.ph/FA8mI), real-name registration became the default across China's online landscape. 

Real-name registration has [always](https://archive.is/1sjYk) increased [self-censorship](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6459495), but recent CAC policies have further ratcheted up the pressure. In 2022, social media platforms began to show users' [IP addresses](https://restofworld.org/2023/weibo-legal-display-name-influencers/) next to their account profiles and comments (an IP address identifies from where a particular device has connected to the internet, and it's [reasonably easy](https://archive.ph/d5rrR) for police to find an offender's IP address and then [obtain the associated real-world address](https://archive.ph/HkdZA) from the relevant ISP). In 2023, platforms began to publicly display the [real names](https://restofworld.org/2023/weibo-legal-display-name-influencers/) of users with large numbers of followers. And in 2024, the government [proposed](%20https://archive.ph/b3nVz) taking over the task of real-name verification from companies, giving users a single ID that identifies them across the internet, making them even easier to track. 

"Rather than retroactively identifying individuals with the help of platform companies, a digital ID to which all accounts are connected allows much more comprehensive, granular, and potentially real-time monitoring of user behavior," says Katja Drinhausen, head of the research program on Chinese politics and society at the Mercator Institute for China Studies. ([Dozens of applications](https://web.archive.org/web/20250206074716/https://www.nchrd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Attachment_internetID_full-analysis.pdf) and [one of China's major telecoms](https://archive.ph/skny1#selection-325.0-325.18) are already testing the system.) The proposed unified national internet ID system is a "real-life policy expression of fear" about unfettered speech, Drinhausen says. "Only those who can be watched and found should be allowed to speak." 

Real-name registration also has the added benefit of keeping out non-Chinese users, in order to protect "the domestic discourse from outside opinion and commentary that is not aligned with the CCP," as Sam Ju, a a researcher [who studies online information controls](https://www.opentech.fund/fellows/sam-ju/), wrote in a [2024 report](https://blocked-by-numbers.opentech.fund/en/) that found 75 percent of Chinese social media apps had implemented real-name registration policies for foreign users, preventing many of them from logging on. "It appears as though China is not only reshaping online discourse rooms to its advantage—it is also drawing a new digital border between a sphere it seeks to influence and a sphere of 'harmful,' non-aligned political ideas."

## Real-Life Consequences for Rule-Breakers

Beijing can punish both companies and individuals for violating its internet strictures. Companies may have to [pay fines](https://webcitation.org/71y4v72U0) or shut down [portions of their services](https://webcitation.org/71y4wnS1A); they may also find their services [removed from local app stores](https://doi.org/10.1080/23738871.2020.1748079) or [suspended altogether](https://archive.ph/WhsBh). In one extreme case, the CEO of a video-streaming platform was sentenced to [42 months in prison](https://web.archive.org/web/20240726224413/https://digitalplanet.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DD-Report_1-Jufang-Wang-11.30.22.pdf) for allowing too much pornography to circulate on the site.

For individuals, the mildest repercussions take the form of deleted posts or deleted accounts—though in the era of the "super-app," a deleted account can make it impossible to [buy groceries or access basic social services](https://archive.ph/IbklW). The next level of punishment—somewhere between having one's posts deleted and facing formal legal penalties—involves being "[invited to tea](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2021/10/translation-spilling-the-tea-about-being-invited-to-tea-and-hearing-the-police-read-aloud-your-tweets/)" by local police. During these "tea drinking" sessions, officers might interrogate offenders  about their internet activities, personal life, or political opinions, sometimes for many hours. Often, in order to be released, an [individual must sign](https://archive.ph/GpuZ9) a confession, or a pledge to avoid untoward internet activity in the future. 

But harsher consequences for individuals can also include fines (one programmer had to pay more than [one million Renminbi](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/09/chinese-programmer-ordered-to-pay-1m-yuan-for-using-virtual-private-network#:~:text=But%20in%20recent%20years%20the,yuan%2C%20for%20selling%20the%20software) for using a VPN), [public humiliation](https://archive.ph/lJTma) (such as televised "apologies" forced on a popular microblogger), temporary [detention](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/olympics-defamation-arrest-tabletennis-08072024100107.html) (for "defaming" a Chinese Olympic athlete, or [falsely claiming](https://www.economist.com/china/2024/10/17/in-china-fib-online-and-find-out) it was snowing when it wasn't), or even [jail time](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/22/man-in-china-sentenced-to-five-years-jail-for-running-vpn) (again, for VPN use). A [2021 study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0920203X20963010), reviewing public information about punishments levied against internet users, found that   
. . . the Chinese government has intensified content controls in online spaces by pushing the burden of censorship further down to the level of individuals. We saw more reports of punishment published by the authorities in the first four months of 2019 than in any single year between 2014 and 2018 . . . our results suggest that authorities have broadened their targets of repression from influential non-party thought leaders to almost anyone who dares challenge official narratives.  
But, even though some of these consequences are serious, most people who violate censorship dictates will never suffer them. Very few people who repost forbidden memes will be "invited to tea," but anyone *could* be.

Thus enforcement of online censorship in China resembles human enforcement of speed limits in the U.S. Speed limits are often set below what is [absolutely necessary for safety](https://archive.ph/EqRxl), and below the speed at which most people drive, giving police officers a pretext to pull over nearly any car they'd like to. Drivers know they won't likely get a ticket for driving a few miles over the limit, and therefore often do so—but they don't usually drive at twice the limit, judging that too big a risk. Still, the day-to-day enforcement of the speed limit varies considerably. An officer can change where he sets up his speed trap; he might be in a good mood, bad mood, or even taking a nap; his department might be pressing him to collect more revenue by writing more speeding tickets. This means that even "reasonably" speeding drivers can find themselves pulled over—even [more so](https://archive.ph/Dfgdh) if those drivers [aren't white](https://archive.ph/EhVdY).

Similarly, in the PRC, the online censorship rules can be quite vague, giving authorities the pretext to declare large swathes of content "illegal" at a moment's notice. Most people aren't too worried about breaking internet censorship rules, knowing that they're unlikely to get caught as long as they're not doing anything too outrageous. At the same time, however, enforcement can be capricious. An internet user who thinks they're well within the bounds of acceptable speech may suddenly find themselves in trouble. And authorities scrutinize and punish the online behavior of certain non-Han ethnic groups at much higher rates than they do that of Han citizens.

Such an inconsistent application of the law might seem amateurish. But in fact, it's much cheaper and more efficient than strictly enforcing the rules against every single violator. Ultimately, the most effective police officer is the one that lives inside citizens' heads.
