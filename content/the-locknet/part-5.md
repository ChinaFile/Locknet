In general, the Locknet only targets communications taking place within or crossing over the country’s borders, removing “bad” or “dangerous” content from circulation. (This contrasts with Beijing’s propaganda efforts, which aim to *inject* content into both domestic and international discussions.) Even so, the effects of the censorship regime can and do ripple outwards into the broader world, because the Locknet was designed to be compatible with the global internet. Just as information from the outside can flow into China, systems built to control information can, and occasionally do, flow outwards. Often, this occurs when users outside China want to interact with services, users, or infrastructure inside China, forcing them to rely on the Locknet for tasks they would otherwise do on the internet.

## Service-Level Censorship, Worldwide

Among the most obvious examples of this spillover effect involve international users experiencing content censorship on China-based or \-designed platforms—essentially, externalized {{< drawer title="service-level censorship" >}}Censorship conducted by a company or entity monitoring the censorship on its own platform or service. This can be accomplished through both manual and automated means, but it only targets the content available on the platform or service in question.{{< /drawer >}}. The online video game Marvel Rivals, for instance, doesn’t allow players to type phrases like [“free Tibet,” “free Xinjiang,” “Uyghur camps,” or “Taiwan is a country”](https://archive.is/rw7V2) in the in-game chat, no matter where in the world the players log on from. 

To avoid this problem, some companies offer separate versions of their apps for Chinese and international audiences, like ByteDance does with Douyin (the Chinese version) and TikTok (the international version). Theoretically, this means that CCP-imposed censorship stays on the Chinese version of the platform—but reality isn’t always that tidy. In 2019, an American teenager [posted a video on TikTok](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/11/27/65030/feroza-aziz-tiktok-makeup-video-went-viral-for-discussing-the-uighur-crisis/), the “foreign” version of the Chinese app Douyin. Made to look like a milquetoast makeup tutorial, the video quickly shifts tone as the teenager decries the Chinese government’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims. TikTok removed the video and subsequently banned her from posting new content. Despite TikTok’s [later claims](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/28/tiktok-says-sorry-to-us-teenager-blocked-after-sharing-xinjiang-videos) that the video had been taken down in error, many observers concluded this was an attempt to silence international discussion of ethnic repression in China.  

International users can also receive censored internet search results. Microsoft’s Bing is a [serial offender](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8ztBERe_FUwdkVPbWxkMHJ2ZG8/edit?resourcekey=0-sq4O8stZ7ZZ4FPKBFohKvA), at times [declining to show](https://archive.ph/zBqeP) certain [search results](https://archive.ph/3L7Ec) and also [censoring the autosuggestions](https://archive.ph/YVmkw) it offers when users begin typing in the search bar. Though it’s unclear whether this behavior is intentional or simply the accidental result of China-tailored software exceeding its boundaries, even properly-functioning search queries can turn up censored results anywhere in the world. One academic study [found](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315213705-27/chinese-censorship-online-discourse-juha-vuori-lauri-paltemaa) that international users searching Google with Chinese-language terms end up with censored search results: “Google largely directs its Chinese language searches to mainland Chinese {{< drawer title="IP addresses" >}}Characters identifying computers or servers using the IP system to communicate over the internet. Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) addresses are composed of a set of four numbers, each with one to three digits, separated by periods (for example, <b>104.18.204.43</b>). Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) addresses are longer and can also include letters (such as <b>1050:0:0:0:5:600:300c:326b</b>).{{< /drawer >}},” the authors write. “When Google searches its images from mainland Chinese servers, it offers contents that have mostly already been censored and therefore Google indirectly subjects its Chinese-language users to mainland censorship.”

AI chatbots developed in China also limit their responses to align with Party-state red lines, even if the user isn’t physically in the country. Several [researchers](https://www.petsymposium.org/foci/2024/foci-2024-0006.pdf) have [shown](https://www.chinatalk.media/p/censorships-impact-on-chinas-chatbots) that such chatbots either provide standard CCP talking points or refuse to answer certain questions altogether. Even if users download and run chatbot software outside of China, where they are [less likely to receive blatantly censored answers](https://interconnect.substack.com/p/was-zuck-right-about-chinese-ai-models), the software might still default to the [CCP’s standard propaganda playbook](https://chinamediaproject.org/2025/02/10/deepseeking-truth/) when formulating responses, like presenting the Party as the best source for accurate information, or treating any negative information about the Party as biased. And many users—including corporate ones, who incorporate Chinese chatbots into their own technology—don’t seem to care whether the chatbots are pro-CCP or not. In a recent test of Nvidia software that had integrated a version of Deepseek’s chatbot, the software [produced answers](https://chinamediaproject.org/2025/03/04/rehabilitating-deepseek/) that parroted “Chinese state framing just as it would appear in the country’s controlled media, particularly on sensitive topics like Taiwan … insist\[ing\] that the island’s ‘reunification’ with the PRC ‘is an unstoppable trend no force can prevent.’”

China’s {{< drawer title="service-level censorship" >}}Censorship conducted by a company or entity monitoring the censorship on its own platform or service. This can be accomplished through both manual and automated means, but it only targets the content available on the platform or service in question.{{< /drawer >}} doesn’t just affect the world’s digital products. The Locknet, like the internet, supports a great deal of meatspace activity, like retail shopping. Many products that Americans sell to one another actually originate in China, from where they are drop-shipped after someone in Arizona or Iowa clicks “purchase.” In some cases, this means that the products sold through these storefronts must abide by China’s censorship rules in order to actually get physically produced.

China-based services do more than simply censor; they gather data about their users. Some of this data-gathering exactly mirrors what all modern social media platforms do, collecting information about users’ interests, emotional state, relationships, and patterns of behavior. The question for users is whether they want to provide that kind of personal information to companies in China, which must provide data to the Party-state upon request. (This concern informed part of the recent debate about banning TikTok in the U.S.) Other data-gathering directly serves to [strengthen censorship back in the mainland](https://archive.ph/Y81DV). The University of Toronto’s CitizenLab, conducting research on WeChat, found in 2020 that “\[d\]ocuments and images transmitted entirely among non-China-registered accounts undergo content surveillance wherein these files are analyzed for content that is politically sensitive in China. Upon analysis, files deemed politically sensitive are used to invisibly train and build up WeChat’s Chinese political censorship system.”

Apps such as WeChat also function to keep Chinese citizens within the censorship bubble even when physically abroad, a “[Chinese-language information silo](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/nyregion/us-wechat-ban.html)” that many Chinese expats [rely on for news](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/08/14/wechat-trap-chinas-diaspora) even when other information is available to them. Essentially, they carry the censorship system with them in their pockets. The Party’s propaganda department did not create WeChat, but its widespread use among Chinese citizens living abroad must count among the department’s luckiest breaks.

Just as they help keep Chinese citizens digitally inside China, Chinese apps can also help keep non-citizens out. As [described](https://merics.org/en/report/increasing-challenge-obtaining-information-xis-china) by researchers at the Berlin-based think tank MERICS, real-name registration requirements for social media platforms—ranging from account verification from a Chinese phone number, government ID verification, to face-scans, to verification by other platform users—”have led to effective access barriers for foreign users” on some apps. Some Chinese apps are not even available for download abroad.

### Network-Level Censorship, Outside China’s Networks

It’s not just apps spreading censorship abroad. The Locknet’s {{< drawer title="network-level censorship" >}}Censorship conducted by equipment placed within an internet network, aimed at all traffic that transits that network. This may include machines positioned throughout an ISP’s network, or machines positioned at international gateways that are designed to handle all internet traffic passing through those gateways.{{< /drawer >}} sometimes accidentally prevents international users from accessing sites and services that they would otherwise be able to reach. This can happen [when international internet traffic transits China](/additional-materials/the-mechanics-of-online-censorship/censorship-how-china-disrupts-the-network/#dns-cache-poisoning), even if the traffic’s final destination is somewhere else. Let’s say an internet user in Malaysia is trying to connect to a South Korean website that is blocked by {{< drawer title="DNS" >}}The system that converts a human-friendly domain name (e.g., “catvideos.com”) into a computer-friendly IP address (e.g., “157.240.22.35”). By converting domain names into IP addresses, DNS allows routers throughout the internet to efficiently send information to the correct destination. DNS relies on <b>DNS resolvers</b> and <b>nameservers</b> to assist with this conversion.{{< /drawer >}} (domain name system) in China. If the user’s DNS query just so happens to run over a route that crosses into China, even briefly, China’s DNS {{< drawer title="middleboxes" >}}Machines that are positioned between two endpoints of online communications, often in order to read the contents of those communications as they pass back and forth.{{< /drawer >}} will kick into action, injecting a false DNS response just as though the user were inside China. The user won’t be able [to connect](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2012/paper/ccr-paper266.pdf) to the South Korean website, and that false information may even be cached on a {{< drawer title="DNS resolver" >}}A server that is the first stop in the DNS lookup process. It receives a domain name from a user and then queries a nameserver to find the corresponding IP address, which it then sends back to the user. DNS resolvers are often run by <b>internet service providers (ISPs)</b>.{{< /drawer >}} in Malaysia, ready to be offered up to anyone else trying to visit the site.

The same {{< drawer title="DNS" >}}The system that converts a human-friendly domain name (e.g., “catvideos.com”) into a computer-friendly IP address (e.g., “157.240.22.35”). By converting domain names into IP addresses, DNS allows routers throughout the internet to efficiently send information to the correct destination. DNS relies on <b>DNS resolvers</b> and <b>nameservers</b> to assist with this conversion.{{< /drawer >}} mechanism has other, more intentional, effects on international users. Even though the government originally deployed DNS blocking to keep people *inside* China from visiting websites *outside* China, officials now [also use it](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-hoang.pdf) to keep users *outside* China from accessing sites and services hosted *inside* China. Instead of including only “dangerous” foreign websites on the blocklist they upload to DNS middleboxes, [authorities also include domestic websites that they’d like to prevent foreigners from visiting](/additional-materials/the-mechanics-of-online-censorship/censorship-how-china-disrupts-the-network/#dns-based-geoblocking). For example, officials have added the Chinese government’s own platform for licensing websites to the DNS blocklist. Someone in France trying to visit the licensing website will send out a DNS query that necessarily has to enter China, and will receive a fake DNS response as a result, preventing them from ever reaching the site. Someone trying to visit the website from inside China won’t have the same problem, as their DNS query will stay within China and therefore never trigger any DNS middleboxes, which are only positioned along the national border.

## International Self-Censorship

These examples all involve the Locknet’s leaking out into the wider world. But people fully outside of the Locknet can also make their own decisions that help spread the reach of China’s censorship. 

For example, over the last dozen years or so, Google has chosen to [comply with about half](https://archive.ph/pu0Qp) of China’s takedown requests for YouTube content. The Ministry of Public Security requested the removal of 412 videos, often about government corruption or top officials in China; Google removed more than 200 of them. Remember, the Locknet ensures that [YouTube is not accessible in China](https://archive.ph/BEzQp), so all of these removals by definition affect content that is only available outside of China.

But decisions to self-censor don’t only affect large, influential corporations. In December 2024, a university in Tokyo [discovered](https://archive.ph/wip/s1Egi) that someone had secretly embedded Tiananmen-related content on its website, meaning that anyone trying to access the site from China would get stopped by {{< drawer title="network-level censorship" >}}Censorship conducted by equipment placed within an internet network, aimed at all traffic that transits that network. This may include machines positioned throughout an ISP’s network, or machines positioned at international gateways that are designed to handle all internet traffic passing through those gateways.{{< /drawer >}}. The school responded by preventing such content from appearing on its site—surely a reasonable decision from an admissions perspective, which wants foreign students to apply. But it also tacitly extends the reach of China’s blocklists beyond its borders.

## International Internet Standards: Efficiency at the Expense of Privacy

Despite all of the headaches that the uncensored global internet causes for China’s leaders, it still behooves Beijing to keep the Locknet connected to, and compatible with, the internet. To this end, [it’s helpful if Chinese companies actively participate](https://doi.org/10.1080/09512748.2023.2294787) in international internet standards-setting bodies, which have been a guiding force in the internet’s evolution in the decades since their founding. “Internet standard-setting” isn’t a mere regulatory process, it can also be lucrative for companies whose standards are adopted as a global norm, giving commercial entities [a financial interest](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2024.2309076) in  participating.)Yet standards developed in China may reflect the same values and norms that underpin the Locknet—for one, that users have no expectation of privacy from their government—and adoption of such standards could alter the global internet in ways that make it less free or that threaten users’ privacy.

Historically, the internet has had to manage a trade-off between efficiency on one side and privacy and security on the other. In its earliest days, the internet had virtually no privacy or security safeguards at all. Only after a number of [large-scale](https://web.archive.org/web/20191213105201/http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/CodeRedII.html) [internet](http://virus.wikidot.com/santy) [outages](https://www.wired.com/2012/02/feb-7-2000-mafiaboys-moment/) in the early 2000s were such safeguards built in. Since then, networks have struggled with the tension between efficiency and privacy—with efficiency concerns usually winning out and privacy safeguards tacked on as possible. But for a government like China’s, which seeks to reduce the amount of information a citizen can conceal from the state, such a tension doesn’t exist at all. Engineers can dream up all the fantastically efficient mechanisms they want, without privacy concerns gumming up the works.

### New IP

A case in point: an internet standards proposal for something called “New IP,” or, as a later iteration became known, “IPv6+.” The Chinese technology company Huawei [first introduced](https://web.archive.org/web/20201101023455/https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/octo-017-27oct20-en.pdf) New IP in an international internet standard-setting body in 2018\. The proponents of New IP presented it as a means to address problems they foresaw for the internet in the coming years, mainly involving speed and dependability. As humans’ uses for the internet expanded and the need for near-instantaneous information transmission increased, they argued, citing “[remote surgery](https://web.archive.org/web/20200331164105/https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Workshops-and-Seminars/2019101416/Documents/Sheng_Jiang_Presentation.pdf)” [multiple times](https://archive.ph/l51dW) as a [model use case](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516181117/https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Workshops-and-Seminars/201807/Documents/3_Richard%20Li.pdf), the internet’s existing mechanisms for routing traffic would simply not be adequately efficient or reliable. “Huawei framed it as a program for exploration,” says Antonia Hmaidi, Senior Analyst at MERICS, but in its essence New IP assumed that “the future of the internet should be based on a new type of infrastructure.”

Huawei was indeed correct that a proposal like New IP would improve efficiency and performance. Imagine, for example, that a major sporting event is being streamed online and everyone in a neighborhood full of super-fans is trying to watch it. Each fan’s phone, laptop, or TV individually sends requests to the broadcaster’s {{< drawer title="server" >}}A computer that “serves up” requested content. Most online information is stored (or hosted) on a server. When a user visits a website, it is a server that actually sends back the website content to the user. Servers exist for many different purposes. Major social media companies have many of them in order to provide content to users quickly.{{< /drawer >}}, and in response the server sends {{< drawer title="packets" >}}What the transport layer creates when preparing data to be sent from one computer to another. When the transport layer receives data from the application layer, it divides that data into segments called packets, which can then be individually processed and routed throughout the internet.{{< /drawer >}} to each one of those devices. It would be far more efficient for the server instead to send out the packets just one time, say, to a cell tower in the fans’ neighborhood, which could then send out copies to all the nearby devices asking for them. However, this is only possible if the internet network itself knows what type of content it’s transmitting and where that content is headed—something that current internet protocols don’t allow. What Huawei proposed was essentially giving the network more insight into the traffic it carries so that traffic could flow more efficiently. It would do so by writing some content or routing information on the outside of data packets, making that information visible to {{< drawer title="routers" >}}A router is a computer and networking device that guides and directs data, in small chunks called <b>data packets</b>, between computer networks. In addition to other functions, routers ensure packets are sent to their correct destination, or IP address, via the best available route.{{< /drawer >}} or other machines throughout the system.

Beyond streaming a big sporting event, there are lots of reasons a country or a company might wish to know more about the information its networks are transmitting. As Hmaidi explains, developing countries just building out their fledgling networks may wish to use a system like this to prioritize critical government services, like payments, over bandwidth-hogging services like Netflix. Or, an {{< drawer title="ISP" >}}An organization that provides users access to the internet, in addition to other related services, such as maintaining <b>DNS resolvers</b>. An ISP may be privately or publicly owned. In many countries, including China and the U.S., ISPs are required to share certain information with law enforcement agencies.{{< /drawer >}} might hope to charge big tech companies extra money for carrying all their traffic.  

Of course, a New IP-type network would also help censors avoid the time and expense of performing {{< drawer title="deep packet inspection" >}}The process of unpacking an internet packet and reading the content contained at the deepest (application) layer.{{< /drawer >}}—no need to waste resources prying open a data packet if you can just get information about its contents from what’s written on the outside.

Specifically, New IP proposed fundamental changes to the “network stack,” or the way in which different layers of internet architecture interact with each other. The current {{< drawer title="network stack" >}}An abstraction that characterizes the relationship between various elements of the online communication process, with one element stacked on top of another in <b>layers</b>. Though there are several different ways of envisioning the stack, all versions describe each layer as having a specific set of dedicated tasks it performs, while having no insight into what happens at the other layers of the stack.{{< /drawer >}} is based on the notion of “layer independence,” which holds that each mechanism, or layer, of the internet should perform its function independently, without knowledge of what happens at other layers. Layer independence has critical implications for privacy and anonymity online. Each layer contains some bit of information about the traffic passing through it: the network layer notes which physical device, such as a computer or phone, sent the traffic; the {{< drawer title="internet layer" >}}The part of the network stack that manages flows of information across the internet. The internet layer organizes traffic and routing among multiple different nodes within and between networks, ensuring that packets reach the correct destination.{{< /drawer >}} checks where the traffic is headed; and the {{< drawer title="application layer" >}}The part of the network stack that conducts high-level data management and translation, such as character encoding, data compression, encryption/decryption, and remote file access. <b>HTTP</b> and <b>HTTPS protocols</b> function at this layer.{{< /drawer >}} contains the actual content of the traffic. Keeping such information disaggregated makes surveillance, and therefore censorship, more difficult (it also makes the network better able to withstand various kinds of failure or error). New IP proposed doing away with layer independence, [collapsing](https://archive.ph/jq1cV) the network and internet layers and thereby tying information about a particular device together with the websites it visited. Other features of New IP had similar implications for surveillance, such as allowing {{< drawer title="routers" >}}A router is a computer and networking device that guides and directs data, in small chunks called <b>data packets</b>, between computer networks. In addition to other functions, routers ensure packets are sent to their correct destination, or IP address, via the best available route.{{< /drawer >}} to [see some information](https://web.archive.org/web/20221109225429/https://dnsrf.org/.k-media/d3c1d810de1e98bdf7af7aa52406e837.pdf) about the content of the traffic they were transmitting, or using [blockchain](https://archive.ph/jq1cV) to create a more permanent record of an individual’s online activity.

New IP was never a fully-fleshed out protocol, but the proposal contained enough detail that it stirred up debate in the internet standards community. On one side, people raised concerns about surveillance, censorship, and whether or not New IP meant that China was now “[openly advocating for others to follow its lead](https://archive.ph/y1s70).” On the other, observers pointed out that New IP [wasn’t fully baked](https://archive.ph/gHIko) and could still be altered; and that [the existing U.S.-led internet order had failed](https://web.archive.org/web/20240122001703/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1329878X231225748) on multiple fronts to protect users’ privacy, meaning that Western accusations of a Chinese plot to upend the internet were hypocritical, [alarmist](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022124023/https://leidenasiacentre.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Chinas-Role-in-Digital-Standards-for-Emerging-Technologies-1.pdf), and “[borderline imperialist-racist](https://archive.ph/y1s70).”

However, one does not need to divine the underlying motivation for New IP—nor believe the U.S. and other Western countries always act with blameless intent in the international sphere—to evaluate New IP at a technical level and assess its purported benefits and risks. A [2020 report](https://web.archive.org/web/20201101023455/https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/octo-017-27oct20-en.pdf) by the internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (an international nonprofit that helps [coordinate naming and address conventions across the internet](https://www.icann.org/en/beginners)) did just that, judging that New IP could threaten users’ privacy. The report questioned the need for New IP as a protocol, citing other protocols already in development throughout the standards community. It also cast doubt on the ultimate efficiency gains New IP would provide, given that the speed of light would continue to act as a brake on information transmission.

### *New* New IP

As a brand name, “New IP” has died an unceremonious death. But [aspects](https://web.archive.org/web/20200515003659/https://ripe80.ripe.net/wp-content/uploads/presentations/16-COOP-NewIP_comms.pdf) of the proposal are still [floating around](https://web.archive.org/web/20230629190002/https://hknog.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IPv6-A-New-Era-of-IP-Networks-for-5G-and-Cloud.pdf) in [standards bodies](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-bier-bierin6/), often under the moniker "IPv6+." (The plus symbol at the end of “IPv6+” is doing a lot of work here. IPv6, without the “+”, simply refers to an updated format for {{< drawer title="IP addresses" >}}Characters identifying computers or servers using the IP system to communicate over the internet. Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) addresses are composed of a set of four numbers, each with one to three digits, separated by periods (for example, <b>104.18.204.43</b>). Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) addresses are longer and can also include letters (such as <b>1050:0:0:0:5:600:300c:326b</b>).{{< /drawer >}}, which has been slowly rolling out worldwide over the last [few decades](https://archive.ph/UcUVY), replacing older IPv4-formatted addresses. The difference between v4 and v6 addresses aren’t relevant for our discussion here, and indeed, most internet users are not even aware this is happening, as computers handle IP addresses behind the scenes. *IPv6+*, on the other hand, aims to alter some of the fundamental processes of internet networks. The tiny little plus symbol causes confusion in two ways: it makes IPv6+ seem like a mere add-on to IPv6, rather than a wholesale re-imaging of how the internet functions. And, at least for these authors, it frequently results in our saying one thing when we mean the other.)

Though not exactly the same as New IP, IPv6+ also discards layer independence and collapses the {{< drawer title="network stack" >}}An abstraction that characterizes the relationship between various elements of the online communication process, with one element stacked on top of another in <b>layers</b>. Though there are several different ways of envisioning the stack, all versions describe each layer as having a specific set of dedicated tasks it performs, while having no insight into what happens at the other layers of the stack.{{< /drawer >}}. IPv6+ did not attract the immediate ire that New IP did, but the international community [appears to have noticed](https://merics.org/en/comment/fragmenting-network-protocols-china-and-end-web-we-know-it) the similarities between the two protocols; in 2022, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute [decided to halt](https://web.archive.org/web/20221206130204/https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/controversial-european-working-group-on-internet-governance-faces-shutdown/) its work on IPv6+.

Regardless of uptake in international standards bodies, Huawei has [already begun](https://merics.org/en/comment/fragmenting-network-protocols-china-and-end-web-we-know-it) using IPv6+ in its [own networks](https://archive.ph/m07Hx). This means that Huawei-built networks around the world, such as those in [Uganda, Rwanda, and South Africa,](https://archive.is/vr4aR) where the company has provided infrastructure at a low cost, will be employing IPv6+. As long as data stays wholly within those networks, it will be transmitted in IPv6+’s easier-to-surveil format. 

No matter its branding, aim, or provenance, any technical specification that eliminates layer independence for the sake of efficiency has the same problem: it leaves internet communications more vulnerable to surveillance and censorship. This may not actually present a problem in some cases, like in a medical intranet that wants to support services like remote surgery but remains separate from the internet as a whole. And for nation-states like China, being able to more easily surveil its citizens’ communications is a feature, not a bug. For the rest of us, though, swiping right on our dating apps or texting memes mocking our government, we may not really want anyone else listening in. As the internet continues to evolve, we must ask: what is the ideal balance between privacy and efficiency, and what safeguards need to be in place to ensure that balance is maintained?
