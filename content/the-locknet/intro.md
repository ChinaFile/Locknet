The man gazes earnestly into the camera, the glow from his computer monitor reflecting off his black-rimmed glasses. "This is more than just a cultural moment," he says. "It's something truly meaningful. This is about mutual respect, kindness, and efforts to understand each other. This feels so good!" he says in a [video](http://xhslink.com/a/MtezFxXAEMTbb) he posted to RedNote, a China-based social media service similar to Instagram.

It was January 14, 2025, and Zheng Yubin was speaking in English to American users who had recently {{< drawer title=surged >}}

Over the following weeks, Rednote played host to what appeared to be heartfelt exchange, as many Chinese users embraced the influx of Americans. Users from the two countries asked each other about their everyday lives, swapped cat photos, and even [did homework together](https://archive.ph/1iQ6y).

But something less joyful lay beneath all the good vibes. The Americans had joined RedNote as a way to protest the U.S. government's [incipient ban](https://archive.ph/jrn4R) of another Chinese platform, TikTok. Advocates for blocking the app [argued](https://archive.ph/I7oO0) TikTok's wide reach, its wealth of information on each of its users, and its obligations under Chinese law could allow China to use it to "sow discord and disinformation during a crisis." American TikTokers, unconvinced, rebelled by downloading RedNote. "Our government is out of their mind if they think we are going to stand for this TikTok ban," a U.S.-based user [said in a video posted on RedNote](https://archive.ph/dfgUs). "We are just going to a new Chinese app and here we are."

Whether or not Washington's fears were well-founded, China's government does indeed have the means to manipulate content on China-based platforms. As a Chinese company, RedNote must obey Beijing's [censorship](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2022/07/how-xiaohongshu-censors-sudden-incidents/) dictates. (In fact, TikTok, which is the international version of the [Chinese app Douyin](https://archive.ph/8pod6), is less censored than RedNote, which only has one, China-based version.) Some newcomers realized this when their RedNote [posts](https://archive.ph/ACKVC) containing political speech got flagged for "violations," or when they found their accounts [shadow banned](https://archive.is/1usn9) or [outright closed](https://archive.ph/VAHt1). In a group chat viewed tens of thousands of times, new RedNote users  "[shared tips in the comments on how to avoid being banned from the platform for bringing up politically sensitive topics](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/business/tiktok-rednote-xiaohongshu-app.html)," while [others said](https://archive.ph/bkBRh) they would "depoliticize" their content in order to "do as the Romans do."

Meanwhile, RedNote itself scrambled to comply with its censorship duties. In January, China's top internet regulator reportedly told RedNote to [ensure U.S. users' posts don't appear in China-based users' feeds](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktok-users-move-to-chinese-app-rednote-alarms-beijings-censors). Some foreign users then reported [sharp drops](https://archive.ph/iLKLJ) in views of their content; others complained that the app [only showed them](https://archive.ph/CS23g) content posted by other foreign users. Through outsourcing companies, RedNote began [recruiting](https://archive.ph/rNjf1) local English speakers to help with content moderation. As of May, the company was [still looking](https://archive.ph/408ST) for people to help review videos posted by foreign users, offering a monthly salary of 5,000 RMB to 8,000 RMB ($700 to $1,100). 

This whole cycle—the proposed ban on one app with ties to China, Americans' flocking to another, the brief window of cross-cultural connection, and finally, censorship's closure of that window—reveals several key facets of China's online censorship apparatus, and about the international community's relationship to it.

RedNote's scramble to patch up newly-exposed censorship vulnerabilities demonstrated both the fragility and adaptability of China's system. New technologies, or new facts on the ground, can quickly open up channels for relatively unfettered discussion. Authorities, government and corporate, can also quickly close them. Most people know that China censors its internet. They've probably even heard of "The Great Firewall," the clever moniker popularly used to describe that censorship. But despite its increasing impact on our online lives, most people outside China don't understand how this information control system really works. What does it consist of? How effective is it? What is its ultimate purpose? And how much does it alter the internet in the rest of the world? 

For more than a year, we—a computer scientist at Northeastern University, and an expert on China's governance and society at ChinaFile—worked as a team to answer these questions. We interviewed experts, reviewed decades' worth of academic literature and media reporting, tracked policy and implementation changes over time, and even did some data analysis of our own. We brought together insights from the fields of computer science, linguistics, political science, and area studies in order to decipher the biggest and most sophisticated online censorship system in the world. And we've come away from this process with several key insights about the system's mechanics, potency, aims, and impact.

NEED SOME SORT OF LINKING WORD(S)? Imagining China's censorship system as a "wall" mistakes its true nature. The system isn't static, it's dynamic, multipart, and adaptable—and concerned with far more than simply repelling foreign information at the border. The system also embodies more than just a stack of servers and wires. It intertwines human and machine into a complex apparatus that pervades the online and offline worlds.

At the same time, the system is a resource-constrained, best-guess, partially-deployed patchwork, every component of which is imperfect and subject to failure at any time. Nevertheless, it remains highly effective. In most cases, "good enough" censorship gets the job done.

In deploying this system, China's government isn't just aiming to control what its citizens see and say online. It has a much bigger ambition: to curate the broader information landscape such that it alters what citizens know, and in turn what they think.

Living in our digitally-connected world means that you probably have some sort of link to this system, whether you want to or not. It increasingly impacts what appears on the global internet, and may end up reshaping international internet infrastructure. We ignore it at our own peril.

Popular notions of China's censorship fail to account for several key facets of the system: how central it is to the Chinese Communist Party's rule, how much it relies on the average person's disinterest in circumventing it, and how dynamic and effective it can be despite its many failings.

For years, [observers](https://archive.ph/ID3Tc) have [argued](https://archive.is/nbyuS) that Beijing would have to ease up on internet censorship in order to safeguard the country's economic growth. Such heavy-handed information control, it was thought, would hinder innovation and productivity, eventually threatening the Party's tacit bargain with its citizenry: material prosperity in exchange for political submission. But this argument fundamentally misread Party philosophy. China's leaders view internet censorship, like a growing economy, as essential to good governance and to their continued rule—and that such censorship becomes even more crucial when the economy is slowing and social discontent is on the rise.  

Many observers also assume that the censorship system is beating back a tide of ardent netizens thirsting for unfiltered information. But when was the last time you sought out foreign news in your second, or perhaps even third, language? In reality, most Chinese internet users thirst after the same things all of us do: TV shows, sports scores, and cat videos, ideally in our native tongues. Even if it's possible to evade the censorship system, the question is not just one of technical capability but of motivation. Often, just a little bit of friction—no circumvention tools on sale in the app store, or a slow or inconsistent connection—is enough to convince people not to bother. After all, if Chinese users so fiercely desired the kinds of cross-cultural connections that flourished briefly on RedNote, they might sign up for Instagram (banned in China) en masse. Instead, they largely stick to the services readily available to them in local app stores.

Of course, China's online censorship system hasn't withered away. Nor has its porousness doomed it to failure. The system remains indispensable to Beijing, and so Beijing has made sure it can grow and adapt in response to the internet itself. 

And as the internet insinuates itself ever deeper into our lives, so does the risk it brings China's censorship along with it.  
part of engaging with China entails engaging with the Locknet, both as it exists within the mainland and as it seeps out to the rest of the world.

A censorship system as powerful and pervasive as China's can't be contained by a line on a map.  
At stake are WHAT and WHAT and WHAT…

## More Than a Wall

Many countries [censor the internet](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/internet-censorship-map/) [to some degree](https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-net/scores?sort=asc&order=Total%20Score%20and%20Status). By blocking specific content, or by limiting access to certain sites or services, states from Venezuela to Uzbekistan circumscribe what their citizens can see online. Some countries—like Russia and Iran—have extensive filtering systems that allow their governments to monitor both content and the users who post it. North Korea simply [doesn't allow most people to get online at all](https://archive.ph/8Ez8S). 

But no other censorship regime rivals China's in scale and complexity. Unlike Pyongyang, Beijing sees the value in letting its citizens visit cyberspace—and in fact continues to bank its [governing](https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-14th-five-year-plan-for-national-informatization-dec-2021/) and [economic](https://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/202112/01/content_WS61a6d009c6d0df57f98e5da0.html) capacity on networked technologies. This means that China has, in some ways, a much more difficult row to hoe than North Korea. China needs the internet, but not *all* of the internet. It must find the means, across a large geographical area, and for [more than one billion users](https://web.archive.org/web/20241126171630/https://www.cnnic.com.cn/IDR/ReportDownloads/202411/P020241101318428715781.pdf) wielding a wide array of commercially-produced computers, cell phones, and smart watches, to limit what information gets transmitted from one point to another. 

For most people outside China, the mention of Chinese censorship immediately brings to mind the moniker "Great Firewall." As a metaphor, "Great Firewall" passably describes the digital fence Beijing has built along its borders. A barrier made up of hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of independent devices, it inspects internet traffic flowing in or out of the country—think of security guards manning border crossings—and disrupts connections it finds carrying objectionable content. In so doing, the Great Firewall conducts "network-level censorship": monitoring internet traffic transiting the broader internet infrastructure, irrespective of who sent it, or from which platform. China's network-level censorship tools, while individually rudimentary, work in tandem to create a system [unrivaled in scope](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~dml/papers/geneva_sigcomm20.pdf). They do so by violating underlying internet norms, like expectations of privacy and authenticity, to take advantage of the good faith and trust built into ordinary internet functions.

Even so, the Great Firewall, or, as the Cyberspace Administration of China [calls it](https://archive.ph/BLUQN), the "[State Data Cross-Border Security Gateway](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/ZS/ZS00/20240723/117542/HHRG-118-ZS00-Wstate-QiangX-20240723.pdf),", can only monitor information leaving or entering China. Internet traffic within China—a WeChat message sent from Guangzhou to Shanghai, say, or a video being streamed from Liaoning to Anhui—never comes into contact with the Great Firewall. But China seeks the option to censor *any* traffic that might reach its citizens, not just traffic originating abroad. This is where "service-level censorship" comes into play. Beijing has tasked "services" such as blogs, social media apps, and gaming platforms, with conducting censorship on its behalf. This holds for any company hosting content in China, not just Chinese ones. Because most, if not all, such platforms have their own corporate content policies that they enforce through post deletion, account blocking, or upranking and downranking, they already have the means to enforce the government's censorship mandates; a platform can just as easily delete a post that violates its advertising policies as one that calls for the downfall of the Party. The distinction between content moderation and censorship lies not in who does the deleting, but on whose orders the deleting is done. 

Companies don't censor their users because they necessarily want to, but rather because it is a condition of operating in China. China explicitly requires companies hosting user-generated content to [close, blacklist, and report to the government](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/personal-media-rules/) all accounts that "create and publish rumors, stir up hot societal topics . . . and transmit illegal or negative information, creating a vile impact." Similarly, the government [expects](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/governing-the-e-cosystem-2/) average users to "interact civilly and express themselves rationally." Such rules cover just about any entity, human or corporate, that might post or host something online, ensuring that the government has a legal basis for removing content and penalizing offenders. THIS NEEDS TO BE PUMPED UP. PUNISHMENTS!  BUREAUCRACY!

These three filters—network-level censorship, service-level censorship, and regulation and enforcement—aim to purify what is circulating on China's domestic internet. The latter two filters manage content produced within the physical confines of China's borders, or within the digital confines of a China-based app, while the first filter, network-level censorship, handles content that authorities can't stifle at the source. Together, they form a socio-technological apparatus that can reach into both the digital and real-world lives of Chinese citizens, if and when it so chooses.

\[GRAPHIC OF HOW ALL THE PIECES OF THE SYSTEM WORK TOGETHER\]  
![][image1]

A censorship system this large undoubtedly costs the Party-state a pretty penny in research and development, new hardware, and day-to-day upkeep—but no one knows exactly how much. In 2021, researcher Ryan Fedasiuk used available government budgets to [estimate](https://archive.ph/kGGOb) that "Chinese government and CCP offices engaged in internet censorship likely spent more than $6.6 billion (nominal USD) annually on related activities. Accounting for purchasing power parity, the number is likely closer to $13 billion." Fedasiuk's calculation is missing a large chunk of central government spending—those figures, naturally, aren't made public—and don't include the costs borne by private industry, meaning it's likely a significant underestimate. The expense of this system stems from the assumptions baked into its design: it must assume that any citizen could be up to no good, thereby making the cost proportional to the total population and not to the number of actual offenders.

Finally, outside observers tend to see China's online censorship system as one of two extremes: either impregnably powerful, or trivial to evade. Neither is accurate. Both implicitly rely on the idea of a wall. "The Great Firewall" suggests an attempt at impermeability, a hard barrier running along the border keeping invading information at bay. This metaphor, while extremely satisfying given its nod to Chinese antiquity, fails to capture the complexity and dynamism of the system as a whole. Beijing doesn't just stand sentry over its digital borders, it monitors and censors information flows within the country as well. Moreover, the censorship system was never designed to be impermeable. Instead, it uses the most efficient means possible to minimize the quantity of "dangerous" information available to Chinese citizens online. (Impermeability is expensive, and not all that much better, from a practical perspective, than simply filtering out the majority of unwanted content.) Finally, a wall is static. It remains, inflexibly, the same height and the same length, in the same location, day after day.

In practice, online censorship in China functions more like a massive water management system: an amalgamation of canals and [locks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_\(water_navigation\)) that regulates what flows, through which particular channels, and at what times. It adjusts to natural rises and drops in volume, though it can be overwhelmed during a flood. Even when the sluices close, it's not perfectly impermeable; ripples can always slosh over edges. This can happen in both directions: a gush can surge in from the outside or what was meant to stay in can leak out.

Just as a system of locks and sluices surrounding a man-made lake can regulate the lake's water level even as tides or rivers flow in and out, China's online censorship system can ensure the information circulating through the country's digital spillways mostly conforms to Beijing's changing whims. The result is a national intra-net that links up with the global internet but manages internal information flows according to its own rules. The result is what we call the Locknet.

## Good Enough, Enough of the Time

Despite the expansiveness of the architecture, the technical system by which censorship is accomplished—particularly network-level censorship—isn't all that technologically advanced. So far at least, it doesn't seem to rely on technologies like artificial intelligence or machine learning. Take, for example, a tool deployed in November 2021 to block fully encrypted communications in real time. Fully encrypted traffic is generally a bane to censors. It appears as a jumble of random, indecipherable characters and symbols, leaving censors to guess whether it represents something innocuous, like a business Zoom call, or whether it is actually banned content trying to evade the censorship dragnet. But even the apparently random jumble does contain some patterns, allowing China's censors to create several basic rules to identify it. So instead of using a sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithm to review traffic as it flowed through the wirescensors programmed the new tool with simple rules like "if more than a certain percentage of these random characters are human-readable, block the traffic." In this way, the network-level censorship system continues to use basic computing techniques to counter emerging communications technologies. 

Nor is network-level censorship composed of a single set of unified hardware. Instead, censors have cobbled it together over the years with equipment from multiple different vendors. "We expected that censorship infrastructure in China was largely monolithic," says Dave Levin, Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, describing his mindset before a set of 2020 experiments. Instead, the results he and his fellow researchers saw made them realize the system is probably much more heterogenous. "The most logical explanation, and our new mental model, is that it's a lot of different boxes" with different operating systems and different flaws, "which likely means different manufacturers."

Minimized chance of error, however, doesn't mean that the Locknet is foolproof. As with many governance processes, it only needs to be good enough, enough of the time, for enough of the population, in order to be effective. Individual components frequently fail; for instance, during [busy](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Earl-Barr/publication/221609631_ConceptDoppler_A_weather_tracker_for_internet_censorship/links/0912f509261c3a8340000000/ConceptDoppler-A-weather-tracker-for-internet-censorship.pdf) [times](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci12/foci12-final2.pdf) of day, too much Internet traffic can flood the system and allow otherwise censor-able traffic to slip through. Computer scientists have repeatedly found that somewhere between [three](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~krish/imc17.pdf) and [25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3442381.3450076) percent of "sensitive" traffic somehow makes it past network-level censors to its final destination, even without any effort to evade censorship. As [one study put it](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crandall/concept_doppler_ccs07.pdf), the system is "more panopticon than a firewall, i.e., it need not block every illicit word, but only enough to promote self-censorship."

Service-level censorship, implemented by private companies at the behest of the government, also doesn't block every illicit word, but rather implements more precision-targeted deletions that quell certain unwanted conversations without stifling all chatter. Take the word "Tiananmen," which can refer not only to the public square in the heart of Beijing but also the government's massacre of civilians there in 1989\. "People think it's totally blocked. It's not," says Sandy Lu, Lead China Subject Matter Expert at [Two Six's Media Manipulation Monitor](https://twosixtech.com/capabilities/global-media-manipulation/), which monitors how governments worldwide manipulate content online. "They let people say, 'Oh yeah, I went to Tiananmen!'" Social media companies like Weibo, which Lu follows in particular, have human moderators that do more careful curation of potentially threatening discussions: "They're taking the most sensitive ones, the ones with the highest engagement rate. You nip those in the bud," she says. "You find the root of the narrative and kill that, and you kill the conversation." Because of this precision targeting, relatively few posts get pulled off Weibo on a daily basis. Only about 2-3% of the posts Lu monitors get deleted, which she is careful to point out is not a representative sample—but which also doesn't count posts that the company automatically blocked before they ever appeared online. 

Another relatively rudimentary censorship method involves keeping specific apps off citizens' phones entirely, through a practice known as "meta-censorship." [Many](https://advox.globalvoices.org/2024/06/25/censorship-and-isolation-as-china-bans-thousands-of-mobile-apps/) [foreign](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/technology/apple-whatsapp-china-app-store.html) [apps](https://appcensorship.org/files/Isolation-By-Design.pdf)—and sometimes, even entire classes of apps, like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which allow users to access otherwise blocked foreign content—are [not](https://www.ft.com/content/ad42e536-cf36-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc) [available](https://censorbib.nymity.ch/pdf/Ververis2019a.pdf) from app stores in China. (For members of certain persecuted groups, like ethnic Uyghurs in northwestern China, having a banned app on your phone can lead to [fines or even detention](https://www.newyorker.com/news/a-reporter-at-large/china-xinjiang-prison-state-uighur-detention-camps-prisoner-testimony).) In turn, meta-censorship leads to "platform substitution," whereby domestic Chinese users end up engaging mainly or exclusively with apps developed in China rather than those more widely available abroad. [Greatfire.org](https://en.greatfire.org/), an organization that tracks online censorship in China, reports that in [Apple's app store, in particular](https://appcensorship.org/files/Isolation-By-Design.pdf),   
"66 apps (61%) out of the 108 most downloaded apps worldwide are unavailable to Chinese iOS users . . . none of the \[Top 10 most downloaded apps\] are accessible to Chinese users. Five apps are simply not available in China's App Store, while the remaining five, though available, are blocked by the government and cease to function once installed on a user's device."  
In 2023, Beijing codified its dominion over corporate app stores; [regulations now require](https://web.archive.org/web/20231214062815/https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-mini-programs-app-registration-end-march-2024/) any mobile apps to get approval from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology before they can appear in China's app stores. Chinese companies, of course, have no choice but to work within these constraints. Foreign companies like Apple actively opt to accept them to gain access to the Chinese market. Much of Beijing's censorship power, therefore, derives simply from its role as a gatekeeper to one of the largest customer bases in the world. 

Good, old-fashioned human labor buttresses more technical means of censorship, whether in the form of for-hire content moderators or police officers' [reviewing](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2021/10/translation-spilling-the-tea-about-being-invited-to-tea-and-hearing-the-police-read-aloud-your-tweets/) user posts. Almost since the advent of the internet in China, authorities have used such a mix of online and offline control practices to minimize the chances something slips through.  
Internet users themselves supplement the network- and service-level censors. 22 Chinese internet users [interviewed by researchers in 2024](https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/8670) all "reported practices of self‐censorship before posting online," often simply opting not to post because "it is useless to speak." The interviewees also "assert\[ed\] that they have a clear understanding of the 'boundary' between sensitive and insensitive topics, enabling them to navigate discussions online carefully" despite the fact that "none of them can clearly draw the line, nor do they draw the same line." Similarly, a [survey](https://academic.oup.com/book/55291) conducted in 2015 asked more than 2,000 respondents "whether they had ever changed the content of what they intended to write on a blog, Weibo post, WeChat message, forum post, or other online post so as to avoid being censored . . . nearly 25 percent indicated that they had done so several times and approaching 7 percent said they had done it many times."

However, though many Locknet users clearly engage in some level of self-censorship, most people don't go through their days thinking of ways to view or post banned material. [One study](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mbD7lOfCVBBEuUIMx-ehOpXAHYYrrQDz) gave Chinese university students access to the uncensored internet via a VPN (this took place in the mid-2010s, when it was still possible to conduct such a study, and to reliably use VPNs at scale); the authors found that many students didn't even bother to try out the VPN, and, among those who did, they didn't seek out uncensored news unless they were specifically encouraged to do so. Most humans, it seems, really do just want to [watch cat videos online](https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/guilty-pleasure-funny-cat-videos). For the rarer people who *do* spend their time thinking of ways to evade censorship, China's system can track and harass them individually, in both cyberspace and in real life.

Indeed, "people experience the Chinese internet in extremely varied ways," says Daniela Stockmann, Professor of Digital Governance at the Hertie School in Berlin. "There are people who believe the internet is very censored, that they don't have space to talk about hot topics or issues of social and political relevance. Other people think the internet is an incredibly diverse space. Of course, it depends on the topics you want to talk about and what platforms you're on."  

But people's experience of China's cyberspace varies not just based on the content they're seeking. Other factors also affect what they're able to do online. Are you an elite academic or a businessperson whose work requires some additional access to international internet services? You may have access to a government-approved VPN that allows you to bypass some censorship. Are you trying to connect from Henan province, where authorities recently implemented [their own, additional network-level censorship system](https://gfw.report/publications/sp25/en/)? You may be subject to "dual-layer censorship," with both the national-level system and the provincial-level one limiting what your computer can reach. "In Henan, specifically starting in 2023, people started noticing that there are hardly any websites they can access," says Ali Zohaib, a PhD student at the Security & Privacy Lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The province's blocklist is extensive, "way more than what \[national network-level censorship\] blocks."

Though certain individuals' identity, location, or interests may afford them a more pleasant online experience, no one is completely safe from crossing Beijing's red lines. The red lines aren't static. Lists of forbidden topics can change, as can the perceived sensitivity of one's own identity—[LGBTQ individuals](https://archive.ph/WethW) now find themselves under mounting pressure from an increasingly conservative Party-state, as do [Hui Muslims](https://archive.ph/TB373). Even if you strive to live within the bounds of the politically permissible, you yourself may become politically impermissible through no action of your own.

 All the vagaries of the Locknet—the imperfect technology; the diffuse implementation; the variances by time, place, and identity; not to mention the creaky infrastructure connecting China's internet with the outside world—can make it quite difficult to understand what the Chinese government is blocking at any given time. Is something blocked, or did it simply get dropped by overloaded equipment? If it is blocked, is it blocked for everyone, everywhere, or only for certain people, or in certain locations, in certain contexts, or on certain apps? Is the block intentional, or simply [collateral damage](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-hoang.pdf) from an unrelated content ban?

From the outside, the Locknet's flaws can be hard to see. But failing to recognize these flaws can lead to [inaccurate suppositions](https://archive.is/31g7q) about what content remains online. Let's say a foreign website with cleverly-disguised, but clearly "subversive," content is accessible in China. What does this tell us? That authorities have chosen not to block it? That someone within the censorship system secretly supports what it says and hopes to get the word out? Not necessarily. Such conclusions would be warranted if China conducted network-level censorship with whitelists—only allowing access to pre-approved websites and services. But China's system generally relies on blacklists, only blocking sites, services, and keywords already identified as problematic. (The sheer volume of "problematic" content can make it easy to forget that, in fact, much more content is not blocked at all.) 

This means that "subversive" content might be accessible in China for a number of different reasons: 

- First, yes, authorities may have chosen to allow it through. But this is only one possibility.  
- A second: authorities may not know it exists, if it is indeed cleverly-disguised or otherwise not caught by the automated dragnet. As yet, the censorship system can only block what it has been told to block. Novel formulations of "subversive" content won't necessarily trigger any tripwires.  
- Third, authorities may know about it but have judged it not important or dangerous enough to bother with. The system doesn't need to be perfectly watertight, just good enough most of the time—and there are likely plenty of cases, especially when considering the differing priorities of central and local authorities, when even "subversive" content just doesn't rise to the threshold of concern.  
- Fourth, authorities may want to block it but have decided that the cost of doing so is too high. This seems to be the case with the code-hosting website Github, popular with computer programmers and very useful to China's burgeoning tech industry. Beijing initially blocked Github in 2013, but quickly [backed down](https://web.archive.org/web/20150330034358/http://www.computerworld.com/article/2493478/internet/github-unblocked-in-china-after-former-google-head-slams-its-censorship.html) after public outcry. Since then, Github is accessible in China only some of the time—clearly still a source of anxiety for authorities, but still too economically important to cut off completely.  
- Finally, authorities may want to block the "subversive" content but do not yet have the capability. If the website in question uses new technology to serve up its content, China's censorship system may not yet have developed a technical countermeasure.

In sum: internet content is available in China either because authorities like it, don't know about it, don't really care about it, don't want to pay the cost to block it, or don't have the means to block it. Notably, only two of these five possibilities represent a situation in which authorities have willingly allowed content to remain online. In the other three scenarios, they're either unaware, incapable, or grudgingly accepting of its presence.

China's online censorship regime in some ways lives up to its fearsome reputation: it is a huge, expensive, and responsive system that uses both humans and machines to purge unwanted content, no matter the platform or format. The automated tools that squelch or forestall "dangerous" speech work  at every phase of an internet connection and pervade the PRC's physical internet infrastructure, seeking to control what Chinese citizens say, see, and, ultimately, think.

At the same time, the Locknet is also a resource-constrained, best-guess, partially deployed patchwork that can fail "open," letting in unwanted content if it is undergoing maintenance or overwhelmed with traffic. The humans in the system, though necessary instruments of successful censorship, often have their own agendas; corporate rivalries or bureaucratic hierarchies can determine what they pull offline.

These two aspects of the censorship system—omniscient and competent on one side, fractured and fallible on the other—reflect the political tension inherent in such a grand project. But, no matter how slapdash or fragmented, the Locknet remains an existential lifeline for a regime that sees itself not only as the sole rightful ruler of China, but as its supreme moral authority as well. If the Chinese government isn't going to liberalize, neither can its internet.

In the early days of the internet, it was easy to see gaps in technological capacity or enforcement as proof that savvy citizens could always evade the system—or even as reason to believe that some of the system's gaps were intentional, a concession to public sentiment or economic reality. But the focus on current failings obscures the longer-term trajectory: the Party-state generally achieves its internet censorship goals, whether it takes days or decades. The regime has the motivation, the patience, and the physical access to ensure that its dictates reign supreme in the end.

Just as in the casino, so it goes on China's internet: eventually, the house always wins.

## Making Thoughts Unthinkable

Censorship, however, is only one part of China's broader information control apparatus. Extensive censorship requires extensive surveillance, in order to identify offenders. This involves collaboration between different sectors of industry and government. As described in the book [*The Xi Jinping Effect*](https://uwapress.uw.edu/book/9780295752815/the-xi-jinping-effect/), a hacker discovered in 2019 that China Telecom, one the country's three major internet service providers, had been storing customers' chat logs "from platforms such as Tencent QQ, WeChat, and Apple's iMessage. The database included names, ID numbers, profile pictures, GPS locations, and network information, among other details." Local police throughout the country, meanwhile, had access to the database "for purposes of censorship and surveillance. This system shows that communication software companies, such as WeChat, provide data, while state-owned telecommunications companies, such as China Telecom, are responsible for integrating the data, and public security agencies conduct screening and manual reviews."   
   
But Beijing isn't content merely to censor, or pull out the weeds, of undesirable content. It also wants to fill the void left behind by injecting or promotingplanting the seeds of favored content. To this end, the Party's propaganda apparatus encourages the production of original material specifically for the internet, trying to match the tone of popular Internet culture—what Manya Koetse of the social media analysis site *What's on Weibo* calls the ["hashtagification" of propaganda. As part of this broader mission to shape online discourse, China limits](https://archive.ph/lKr0Y) who can join certain online spaces in the first place. For example, numerous hurdles exist for international users trying to sign up for accounts on popular China-based apps, in effect silencing them before they've even had a chance to be censored.

Sometimes, the addition and subtraction of internet content takes place in the open. The government may announce it has suspended several platforms for lax censorship, or given out ["positive energy" awards](https://archive.ph/92oY8) to the most "heart-warming or ideologically sound stories, photos, and people" appearing online.  But in other cases, the processes of deletion and promotion are deliberately kept hidden. A user might search for facts about COVID-19 or the South China Sea, and receive bowlderized search results, without knowing anything has been omitted. Similarly, that same user might find their social media feeds dominated by accounts that platforms have upranked at the government's behest. MAYBE GIVE REDNOTE EXAMPLE

China's information control system has increasingly relied on such covert tactics over time, perhaps because, as Vuori and Paltemaa [explain](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315213705-27/chinese-censorship-online-discourse-juha-vuori-lauri-paltemaa), "in its ideal form, censorship is totally invisible, and is able to make thoughts unthinkable, not just uncommunicable. Here, censorship aims to affect the formation of discourses, not just their contents. For that to happen, the user must not be aware that the contents . . . are being censored."

Even among the material that authorities do successfully censor, gradations exist. As political scientists Juha A. Vuori and Lauri Paltemaa [have shown](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315213705-27/chinese-censorship-online-discourse-juha-vuori-lauri-paltemaa), China's censorship apparatus implicitly distinguishes between "dangerous" and "bad" information, something made apparent by how long certain terms remain blocked online. "The longer a word remains filtered, the more lasting danger it constitutes for the political system," Vuori and Paltemaa write. "Dangerous" words, censored for at least one year, "either dealt with the 'hard core' of the political system and its functioning, or opposition to it." "Dangerous" words included those that referenced topics such as the Politburo Standing Committee or national leadership succession. By contrast, merely "bad" words, blocked for shorter periods of time, presented only a temporary threat to the regime. The authors categorized these "bad" words as related to "Incidents, Scandals, Corruption, Crime/Misbehavior, Place Names, Disharmony/Unrest, and Company."

To the best of our knowledge, the Chinese government hasn't proclaimed the "bad"/"dangerous" distinction anywhere; indeed, the more "dangerous" a topic, the less the government wants to publicly discuss censorship of it. And yet, the online platforms must still use this distinction, and other such implicit government decrees, as a template for their service-level censorship efforts.  

Like social media companies the world over, Chinese platforms each publish their own content policies, meant to guide user behavior and offer clear boundaries the platform can use to police user-generated content. These content policies include both company-imposed rules (like forbidding competitors' advertisements) as well as government decrees (such as forbidding "erotica"). They often include detailed examples of prohibited material. Yet, in abiding by the government's unwritten rules, platforms can only provide explicit examples for relatively innocuous information. "Dangerous" content receives short shrift—perhaps just the repetition of vague government jargon. Therefore, corporate content policies, particularly where they seem a bit generic or hazy, inadvertently reveal how "dangerous" the government believes a topic to be.

WeChat's "[Content Rules](https://archive.is/wSWhE)," for example, offer up the following illustration of prohibited, but not "dangerous," gambling-related content:  
![][image2]

By contrast, WeChat provides no explicit examples of what kinds of content might  "damage national honor and interests" or "subvert state power."  

This ambiguity holds even when a user has already violated the rules. A respondent to a 2024 survey [told researchers](https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/8670) that, even though they had appealed to WeChat more than 20 times after finding their account blocked, they still couldn't get any more information about their transgression: "They only tell you that you are breaking the rules, but they can't tell you exactly what the rules are, or what I am posting that is breaking the rules."

For certain types of "dangerous" information—like the Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, 1989—Beijing doesn't just want to remove content, but to "memory-hole" knowledge itself. Ideally, memory-holing eventually purges all traces of "incidents" such as June 4th from individual and collective consciousness. Of course, platforms still need their employees to know enough about memory-holed information to effectively delete it, creating a tension between the ultimate goals of censorship and the practical needs of implementation. Last year, an employee at a major Chinese internet platform [described to an interviewer](https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/features/china-internet-content-monitor-censorship) how the company handled this tension:   
"We've had training about evil cults, like Eastern Lightning \[a banned spiritual group\]. But it was just a PowerPoint presentation. No photos were permitted. As soon as it finished, the company quickly took everything away. All of the company's training is secretive like that. My impression is that they need us to know about these things to do our job properly, but at the same time, they're afraid of us knowing too much. They'd prefer we forget everything after executing their instructions. It's really messed up."

This awkward tension between erasure and execution recurs throughout the system, affecting both man and machine. The platforms have a unique challenge: they must create actionable rules for their human employees and automated systems about topics that, from a political perspective, don't exist. Their coders must know enough verboten information to properly program the platform's content review algorithms, but the platform's users can never be let in on the secret. Platforms have to tell their machines "no June 4th," but they can't tell their users "no June 4th."

And this gets at the heart of the broader information control system: the goal is not just to limit what people see and say, but ultimately to limit what they know and believe. What most people think of as the system's objectives—forestalling collective action, minimizing criticism of the government—are indeed present, but they only represent the system's more tactical aims. The longer-term strategy is far more ambitious. To quell more distant threats, the Party hopes to cultivate an information landscape that won't allow unwanted thoughts to grow.   

## Sloshing Over the Edge

A censorship system as powerful and pervasive as China's can't be contained by a line on a map.  
China's integration into the global economy means that this ambition isn't confined within national borders. For example, any company hoping to do business in China must accept the fact of the Locknet, and may find itself building Beijing's censorship rules into its global products. The wildly popular online video game Marvel Rivals, co-developed by the California-based Marvel Games and the Zhejiang-based NetEase Games, indeed follows these rules. The game doesn't allow players to type phrases like [“free Tibet,” “free Xinjiang,” “Uyghur camps,” or “Taiwan is a country”](https://archive.is/rw7V2) in the in-game chat, no matter where in the world the players log on. Marvel thus made the choice to create an international product it knew would impose Chinese censorship on global users. How many more companies will make, or are already making, a similar choice?   
Beijing's preferences about basic internet norms and technologies are seeping out into the international community, by dint of increased global integration at the government, corporate, and individual levels. Some of these technologies—already deployed in places like [Uganda, Rwanda, and South Africa](https://archive.is/vr4aR)—explicitly subvert long-standing expectations of user privacy in the name of greater efficiency, potentially facilitating easier surveillance and censorship for the companies or governments that control them. Global uptake of such technologies would reduce the ability for users around the world to safeguard their own freedom of expression.

Foreigners are right to be wary of China's information control juggernaut.  China's leaders view speech, expression and free access to information very differently from their counterparts in liberal democracies. These views, and the values that underlie them, shape the country's laws and permeate China's domestic internet infrastructure, a digital domain built to reflect the views of those at the top–and in digitally-interconnected world, that means their impact is global.

The online world already has an outsized influence on almost all aspects of our lives: what we consume, what we create, what we know.

Americans' behavior during the RedNote episode revealed how unprepared many of us are to deal with the Locknet. Though many TikTokers [claime](https://web.archive.org/web/20250117150534/https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-656_ca7d.pdf)d the proposed ban would violate their first amendment rights, a large number of the "refugees" flooding RedNote hastened to sanitize their content to suit the Chinese government's restrictions on speech. The irony of this self-censorship seemed lost on many of the TikTok refugees, as did the true nature of censorship enforcement in China. One exiled activist [wrote](https://archive.ph/FV04h) at the time, "The same complaint that brings you to RedNote have brought\[sic\] countless Chinese to jail. And the very app \#RedNote you are using now is part of the state machine that white-washes the Uyghur, Tibet and Hong Kong issue, as well as silencing the entire voices of political prisoners, scholars, civil journalists, filmmakers, LGBTQ and feminists . . ." 

Without a real understanding of what Chinese censorship is, those of us outside China could well end up implementing it ourselves.
