&lt;p>The internet is not one thing, but rather a “network of networks.” A personal computer in Iowa, for example, does not have a single, dedicated wire physically connecting it to the recipe website Epicurious. Nevertheless, an Iowan (let’s call her Marjorie) can get all the recipes she wants simply by pointing her web browser to epicurious.com.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &lt;strong>network&lt;/strong> is &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/how-does-the-internet-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">a group of connected computers that are able to send data to one another&lt;/a>. Marjorie’s request to fetch data from epicurious.com first travels through her immediate network. In Marjorie’s case, this means it goes from her computer to the modem in her home, which then &lt;a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm#:~:text=After%20your%20packets%20traverse%20the,the%20ISP%20buys%20bandwidth%20from." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">relays&lt;/a> the request to equipment run by her &lt;strong>Internet Service Provider&lt;/strong>, or ISP. (An ISP is an organization that connects users’ home devices to the rest of the internet. Most home users pay a monthly bill to their ISP for internet service. An ISP is often a company, but can sometimes be another type of organization, like a university.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Censorship: How China Disrupts the Network</title><link>https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/the-mechanics-of-online-censorship/censorship-how-china-disrupts-the-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/the-mechanics-of-online-censorship/censorship-how-china-disrupts-the-network/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="network-level-censorship">Network-Level Censorship&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Chinese authorities have many political, legal, and bureaucratic methods to avoid unwanted information circulating on the country’s domestic internet. They can deny website registration licenses, or mandate that companies such as Apple &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/apple-says-it-is-removing-vpn-services-from-china-app-store-idUSKBN1AE0BX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">remove&lt;/a> censorship circumvention tools from local app stores. They can also outsource censorship to the online platforms themselves, holding the platforms responsible for any content that appears on their services—a technique known as &lt;strong>service-level censorship&lt;/strong>. (Reports of Weibo or WeChat &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/17/chinese-social-media-companies-remove-posts-showing-off-wealth-and-worshiping-money" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">removing content&lt;/a> from their platforms are examples of service-level censorship.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Executive Summary</title><link>https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/executive-summary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/executive-summary/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a href="https://www.chinafile.com/sites/default/files/locknet_executive_summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">Download a PDF of this Executive Summary&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>China, its companies, and its citizens play a major role in the global internet: producing infrastructure, services, and content upon which people around the world depend. Yet, China’s extensive online censorship system remains poorly understood by most of the internet’s users, and the ways it alters both the physical and digital architecture of the internet are too often overlooked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more than a year, ChinaFile Senior Editor for Investigations Jessica Batke and Northeastern University Assistant Professor Laura Edelson explored how China censors its internet, interviewing experts, reviewing decades of computer science research, and tracking policy and regulatory changes over time. Their cross-disciplinary approach afforded them a broad view of the interplay between the technological and social aspects of China’s censorship regime, yielding new insights about the system’s purpose, its capacity, and its likely trajectory in the years to come. It also allowed them to clear up longstanding misconceptions and establish new frameworks for future research.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Locknet: How China Controls Its Internet and Why It Matters</title><link>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/intro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://locknet.chinafile.com/the-locknet/intro/</guid><description>&lt;/br>
&lt;p>The man gazes earnestly into the camera, the glow from his computer monitor reflecting off his black-rimmed glasses. “This is more than just a cultural moment,” he says with a smile. “It’s something truly meaningful. This is about mutual respect, kindness, and efforts to understand each other. This feels so good!” he exclaims in a &lt;a href="http://xhslink.com/a/MtezFxXAEMTbb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">video&lt;/a> he posted to RedNote, a China-based social media platform similar to Instagram.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blocking Circumvention Technologies</title><link>https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/the-mechanics-of-online-censorship/blocking-circumvention-technologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/the-mechanics-of-online-censorship/blocking-circumvention-technologies/</guid><description>&lt;p>China’s censorship system not only targets “dangerous” content, but also targets users’ attempts to evade the system itself. After all, Beijing spends a lot of money and effort to curate the domestic information environment and keep “dangerous” information outside the country’s digital borders. There would be no point to such an undertaking if it were trivially easy to sidestep the censors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since about 2010, China has put a special premium on hunting down and blocking information about and access to censorship circumvention tools. The censors are engaged in a seemingly endless arms race with circumvention tool developers, who try to create countermeasures after each new block. (It is worth mentioning that Chinese authorities do not block every single possible circumvention tool. Bowing to economic necessity, the government maintains a list of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-vpn-crackdown-may-aid-government-surveillance-1516189155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">approved technologies&lt;/a> that allow foreign businesses and others to circumvent the censorship system in order to send secure emails or visit blocked websites. These approved circumvention tools also likely allow the government to surveil communications sent within them.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Glossary</title><link>https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/glossary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/glossary/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Application layer&lt;/strong> - The part of the network stack that conducts high-level data management and translation, such as character encoding, data compression, encryption/decryption, and remote file access. &lt;strong>HTTP&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>HTTPS protocols&lt;/strong> function at this layer.&lt;/p>

The internet, as a product of meatspace, is subject to the dictates of meatspace. Governments and societies around the world seek to mold and constrain the internet in countless ways. In China, this takes several different forms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="administering-the-censorship-system">Administering the Censorship System&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For one, China’s government has produced a raft of &lt;a href="https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/notes-on-china/#law-constrains-the-people-not-the-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-5 hover:text-blue-6 hover:underline decoration-dotted decoration-2 underline-offset-2">laws and regulations pertaining to cyberspace&lt;/a>.

The “Great Firewall” is just that: a digital border flanking the real one, separating domestic and foreign. As long as Chinese internet users are sending group messages in WeChat, opining for the public on Weibo, or livestreaming themselves on Kuaishou, the information they’re transmitting will never leave domestic cyberspace. It will still be subject to surveillance and censorship, of course—but that comes at the hands of private tech companies, who have accepted such tasks as the price of operating in China.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notes on China from a Computer Scientist</title><link>https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/notes-on-china/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://locknet.chinafile.com/additional-materials/notes-on-china/</guid><description>&lt;p>The goal of this project is to explain both &lt;em>how&lt;/em> China has built such an effective system for controlling the flow of information on the internet and &lt;em>why&lt;/em> its leaders are willing to go to such lengths to do so. I’m a computer scientist, so the technical side of this enterprise seemed relatively straightforward, but I initially found myself quite puzzled at the rationale behind China’s censorship as a whole. Like a lot of folks with degrees in the sciences, during college I was required to take exactly one history class (I chose Modern European History) and I knew little about China before beginning this project. However, as I learned more about the country’s political system and how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has held onto power, its approach to online censorship felt less perplexing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>III.

Just before Gu’s freeski big air event, &lt;a href="https://archive.is/OmSOD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">an irked Instagram user asked Gu&lt;/a>: “Why can you use Instagram and millions of Chinese people from mainland cannot, why you got such special treatment as a Chinese citizen.

(This contrasts with Beijing’s propaganda efforts, which aim to &lt;em>inject&lt;/em> content into both domestic and international discussions.) Even so, the effects of the censorship regime can and do ripple outwards into the broader world, because the Locknet was designed to be compatible with the global internet. Just as information from the outside can flow into China, systems built to control information can, and occasionally do, flow outwards. Often, this occurs when users outside China want to interact with services, users, or infrastructure inside China, forcing them to rely on the Locknet for tasks they would otherwise do on the internet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VI.

Control over information, and thus influence over what citizens know and believe, forms part of the bedrock on which the Party edifice stands. In the modern world, this necessarily involves internet censorship. As General Secretary Xi Jinping &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/KyXyQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-700 hover:underline">said in a 2018 speech&lt;/a>, “Without internet security there is no national security, economic and social stability do not function, and it becomes difficult to safeguard the interests of the majority of the people.” Of course, in China, “internet security” doesn’t just mean keeping one’s data safe. It means content control.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
